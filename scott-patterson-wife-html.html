Here is everything you need to know about the actor, his wife, and his son.&nbsp;</p><h2>Scott Patterson's Wife Was on 'Gilmore Girls'</h2><p>Sarayan made an appearance of Gilmore Girls as Chrissy, Miss Patty's dance assistant, in 2004. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She appeared on the 21st episode&nbsp;of Season 4 named 'Last Week Fights, This Week Tights.'&nbsp;</p><p>She also starred in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life's second episode named 'Spring' in 2016.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She played the role of a 38-Year-Old Woman. Patterson also reprised his role as Danes for the miniseries.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Many people speculate Patterson met his wife in the set of Gilmore Girls. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, the pair started dating around 2001 after meeting during the intermission of a play they both attended.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Sarayan was cast in the role in 2004, Patterson did not meet his wife on <a href=# rel=follow>Gilmore Girls</a>, but they were already dating back then. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to Us Weekly</a>, they&nbsp;married in 2001, but the actor clarified via Facebook that they married in 2014.&nbsp;</p><p>The two have a son named Nicholas, who was born in June 2014. Patterson shared the news via Twitter, where he posted a picture of baby Nicholas.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He thanked his fans and followers for their love and support and announced that his son was 8 pounds and 2 oz at the time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Since then, the actor has often shared updates about Nicholas on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>It is evident that Patterson loves his son a lot since he always gushes about how much he adores Nicholas.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Other than that, Patterson has kept his personal life relatively private since he rarely posts about his wife.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Sarayan is Patterson's second wife. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">actor shared with People</a> that he was previously married to Vera Davich for two years in 1983.</p><p>However, the marriage fell apart because of two reasons â€” the actor was constantly on the road, and neither of them was mature enough to be married.</p><h2>The Age Difference Controversy</h2><p>Patterson and Sarayan have a huge age gap that has raised many questions.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The controversy started on r/GilmoreGirls, where people talked about how Sarayan was a teenager when she began dating Patterson. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>After many backlashes, the actor took it upon himself to clarify the age difference controversy. On April 6, 2021, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stated via Facebook</a> that the inaccurate stories were troubling his wife.</p><p>As a result, Patterson felt "compelled to set the record straight. " He said that Sarayan was 21, and he was 41 when they first met.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>They were introduced by Sarayan's friend when they were attending a play, and during that time, Patterson had already been cast in Gilmore Girls. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He&nbsp;also explained that Sarayan got the role of Crissy after auditioning for it.&nbsp;</p><p>He ended his statement, asking people not to spread damaging rumors about him and his personal life for clicks and views.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKuTpMG1ec%2Baq62doqi8r3nWop2eZpipuq0%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kristy-swanson-arrested-acts-like-buffy-the-ex-wife-slayer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kristy Swanson Arrested, Acts Like Buffy the Ex-Wife Slayer">&larr;
