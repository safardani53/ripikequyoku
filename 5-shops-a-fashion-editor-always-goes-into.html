BIKINI BARGAINS</strong><br>I'm not a big fan of paying a fortune for a bikini, so I always hit M&S as they have great swimwear all year round. Solid hold-you-all-in fabrics, loads of sizes and they wash well.

COOL BEANIES</strong><br>Arket does the same chunky knitted beanie hats each year and they're so warm and cosy. There are a great selection of colours, but I tend to stick to a neutral that will go with all my coats.<br><strong>Beanie hat, £47, Arket – <a aria-label="BUY NOW (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">BUY NOW</a></strong></p><p><strong>2.

SHOW SOME FLARE</strong><br>The 70s trend never really goes away, so while I love a 'barrel leg' and a ‘mom’, I'm a huge fan of a pair of high-waisted flares - they are the most flattering jeans out there. These also have a bit of stretch - perfect!<br><strong>Jeans, £87, Arket – <a aria-label="BUY NOW (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">BUY NOW</a></strong></p><p><strong>4.

BELT UP</strong><br>I can’t tell you how much a great belt finishes off a pair of trousers.

I fell in love with their ‘LifeWear’ when the brand came to the UK 21 years ago. If you are a fashion geek and like to take one in each colour like me, then this is the store for you. The designer collaborations are also excellent (as are the socks!).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/NINTCHDBPICT000869596761.jpg><p><strong>WHAT I ALWAYS LOOK OUT FOR...</strong></p><p><strong>1.
