I predict we’re gonna see him in the finals."</p><p>"Caleb was extremely dominant. Very impressive to say the least," wrote another.</p><p>A third joked on the fumble with the sports category: "Caleb said 'The internet's gonna love that', which it undoubtedly will."</p><p>Caleb then buzzed in on the thread to write: "Hi all, Caleb here.&nbsp;Obviously this game went well for me, but what the audience doesn’t see is the 2 days of waiting through 8 other quarterfinals that Hannah, Maggie, and I went through and how all that waiting really gives nerves time to fester."&nbsp;</p><p>He joked: "Yeah, I’ve spent the last month since filming wondering what exactly was going through my head when I made that third Daily Double bet. I think the answer is something around ‘hubris that comes from being in the zone’ and ‘why not’."</p><p>Caleb - who was a semifinalist in his first teen tournament then defended host Mayim: "I’m pretty <a href=#>sick of all this anti-Mayim talk.</a></p><p>"Of course, one can have favorites or express criticism, but disliking the game can be a self-fulfilling prophecy for people who excessively hating on Mayim.</p><p>I found her lovely, calming, and professional. I’m sure any of the other <a href=#>High School Reunion Tournament contestants </a>would say the same. Once again, thanks for loving this show that I grew up with."</p><p>The 'chai'-scorer also posted that he wagered with 18's since it's a "symbolic number in Judaism, in case you were wondering."</p><h2>WHAT IS: THE SCHEDULE?</h2><p>The other semi-finalists of Mayim's tournament are <a href=#>Tim Cho</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Lucas Miner</a>, 2018 Teen Tournament winner&nbsp;<a href=#>Claire Sattler,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>Jackson Jones</a>, <a href=#>Stephanie Pierson,</a> 2019 Teen Tournament winner&nbsp;<a href=#>Avi Gupta</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Justin Bolsen</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Maya Wright</a>.</p><p>The semi-finals will begin tomorrow, as Mayim read from her cue card at the end of the episode.</p><p>There will be three semi-finals until the 6 of the remaining students are dismissed, then there will be a two-day total point affair finals ending on March 9th.</p><p>On Monday,<a href=#>&nbsp;</a><a href=#>longtime producer Sarah Foss</a>&nbsp;cleared the board on the&nbsp;<a href=#>hosting schedule for the rest of the season</a>&nbsp;on the show's&nbsp;<a href=#>podcast</a>.</p><p>It was announced that&nbsp;<a href=#>Ken&nbsp;Jennings</a>, 48, will be back after Mayim's three-week tournament, but not for very long.</p><p>"Ken Jennings will be back on March 10th and then he will continue the rest of his syndicated run which will take us through April 28th.</p><p>"Then Mayim will take over on May 1st and she’ll take us all the way through the summer."</p><p>Fans were left in a frenzy since after May 1st, we won't see Ken on the regular show until Season 40, or September 2023.</p><p>The internet has not been shy in begging the <a href=#>game show</a> to just let him host the syndicated series, making their host preference cruelly crystal clear.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Fans aren't alone - last year,&nbsp;<a href=#>Amy Schneider</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Mattea Roach</a>&nbsp;stated in interviews they prefer Ken given he went from its winningest contestant (74 victories in 2004) to host, as did recent&nbsp;<a href=#>divisive three-day champ Jake Dearruda</a>&nbsp;slamming Mayim as&nbsp;"inconsistent."</p><p>The energy in the room seems to be that the sitcom star with no notable past ties to Jeopardy is doing perfectly well on&nbsp;specials like&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Jeopardy!</a>, a former champion recently told&nbsp;The U.S. Sun&nbsp;<a href=#>she should stick to that</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/fans-think-know-win-student-799829632.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/fans-slam-mayim-bialik-hard-797086869-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/3b5b7aa9-0e09-4b46-aaca-a6b2afdc70cf.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZWiBcoSWaKGep6CWv6XFjJyYpZ2SYr%2Bqr8empqecXZ22qLSMrJqhp5%2BherOx1KegqKZdqby2vs2apJ6mpGLEqrrNnqlo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bellingham-goal-real-madrid-debut.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jude Bellingham enjoys dream Real Madrid debut as he scores volley... then celebrates in front of ri">&larr;
