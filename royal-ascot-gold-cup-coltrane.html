We thought he was useless when he first came here, he could barely get to the top of our gallops!</p><p>I remember saying to his owners there is a good chance we’d be selling him before too long, but he proved me wrong the moment he set foot on the track.</p><p>Then he suffered a bad injury at the end of his three-year-old season and there was a chance he would never race again.</p><p>He was gelded and was off the track for over a year before coming back, better than ever.</p><p>He ran some good solid races on his return but didn’t win again until taking the Ascot Stakes in 2022.</p><p>That really gave us a big thrill, as did his win in the Doncaster Cup when he beat Trueshan — and also when beaten just a head here on Champions Day.</p><p>His prep has gone well and I think he has come on a bit for his win here in the Sagaro in May.</p><p>He goes into today’s big race in great shape. It goes without saying that it would bring a great deal of joy to all of us at Park House if we can win this historic old race.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Horse Racing</h2></p><p class=has-text-align-center><a aria-label="ROYAL ASCOT BETTING OFFERS - BEST FREE BET RACING DEALS (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#><strong>ROYAL ASCOT BETTING OFFERS - BEST FREE BET RACING DEALS</strong></a></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=#>ROYAL ASCOT LIVE - ALL THE LATEST ON EVERY RACE</a></strong></p><p>I will be pacing the paddock like a cat on a hot tin roof when they head down to the start, but I have every confidence in him.</p><p>Contrary to what many think he is not named after the actor and comedian Robbie.</p><p>He is actually named after legendary jazz musician John Coltrane. I am sure Oisin Murphy will get a great tune out of him this afternoon.</p><p>We also run Nate The Great who is a grand horse, but he is tough to place right now because he is high in the weights.</p><p>Hopefully he can run well and give jockey Harry Davies a nice spin and his owners a good day out.</p><p>It’s not all about the Gold Cup though. I have never hidden my fondness for SEA OF ROSES (3.40) and I think she is well overpriced in the Ribblesdale.</p><p>I was pleased with her first run of the season in France and at York in the Musidora.</p><p>She was a little disappointing in the Oaks but I think the ground was fast enough for her and I’m not sure she acted on the track.</p><p>She is still showing us all the right signs at home and I think she can outrun her odds, for all the favourite looks like she will be tough to beat.</p><p>We have a couple in the King George Handicap which is one of the most competitive races of the week.</p><p>I really like SISYPHUS STRENGTH (3.05) for this. She lost her action on soft ground at Chester so it was great to see her bounce back with a good run at Goodwood.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>She will love the step up to 1m4f and she is well-drawn in 18, which is where you want to be over this course and distance.</p><p>We also run LIEBER POWER who disappointed us at Newbury, but he has ability and he should also be happier over this longer trip.</p><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>FREE BETS <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>GET OVER £2,000 IN SIGN UP OFFERS HERE</a></h4><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
