There’s no point in warming up the rest of the place when it’s sitting empty.</p><p>"The hallway and my bedroom can get really cold. It’s not good at all.</p><p>"The prices now are just absolutely ridiculous. Something needs to be done about it."</p><p>Retired <a href=#>RAF</a> serviceman John decided to stay in <a href=#>Scotland</a> after he finished his final tour of service at Kinloss, Moray.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/www-instagram-com-p-czubwagiz7u-864958570.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/www-instagram-com-p-czubwagiz7u-864958684.jpg><p>He and wife Felecienne fell in love with Braemar and lived there for more than 20 years.</p><p>But tragedy struck in August this year when she died aged 75.</p><p>Devastated grandad John now faces his first Christmas on his own and has to make some changes.</p><p>He said: "My finances have been chopped in half now. I’ve got to cut back a bit.</p><p>"But if my wife was here there is absolutely no way she would let me get away with only heating one room. Everything would have to be switched on."</p><p>John has a coal fire that council bosses want to pull out as part of a move to be more eco-friendly.&nbsp;</p><p>But the veteran has refused so far because he wants to keep it for emergencies.</p><p>He added: "We can be completely cut off for weeks at a time so it’s handy to have. But I’m not complaining.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/braemar-aberdeenshire-people-used-low-864234080.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/arx0ep-motorist-attempts-dig-car-865342765.jpg><p>"No one forced me to live here and it was my own choice. I don’t mind a bit of hardship."</p><p><a href=#>Braemar</a> prides itself on its community spirit and the grandfather, who has family all over the world, was invited to have <a href=#>Christmas</a> dinner at a local hall.</p><p>He said: "I’ve never been a widower at this time of year before.</p><p>"A girl came and asked me to go to Christmas dinner in the village but I said no. I’d rather just have it myself.</p><p>"But that’s what Braemar is like. It must be one of the nicest places in the world."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A-list hangout</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/braemar-aberdeenshire-people-used-low-864234027.jpg><p>There is no radio signal in Braemar and the only supermarket is the local <a href=#>Co-op</a> corner shop.</p><p>Supermarkets deliver but if there’s bad weather they can’t make it in by road.</p><p>At the end of 2015, Storm Frank saw the village completely cut off when it lost a bridge and visitors faced a 120-mile round trip to get in or out.</p><p>The crisis forced the community to set up its own local care service so those in need are always looked after.</p><p>The village is close to <a href=#>royal holiday home Balmoral</a> and is a magnet for tourists and <a href=#>celebs</a> - like <a href=#>Rita Ora</a> who recently stayed at The Fife Arms hotel in town.</p><p>The popstar wrote on Instagram: "I had the most incredible time in Scotland... I'll be back soon."</p><p>The rural area also plays host to the annual <a href=#>Braemar Gathering</a>, attended by <a href=#>King Charles</a> and <a href=#>Queen Camilla</a> in September this year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/photo-andy-buchanan-afp-photo-841931180.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Second homes row</h2><p>It’s packed with second homes and it’s thought that in peak season the population goes up by at least another 600 people.</p><p>But it’s feared this has caused property prices to soar, making it too expensive for young people to either stay or move to.</p><p>When winter hits it becomes a ghost town as the extreme cold weather takes hold and there are very few visitors.</p><p>There is no pipeline gas supply so that has to be bought in, and residents say the cost of that has soared by at least a third over the past couple of years.&nbsp;</p><p>They’re now paying out at least £15 a day.</p><p>But they admitted they have no choice because of the danger of frozen pipes as temperatures plummet.</p><p>One villager said: "A newbie with a second home here is always easy to spot. After their first summer they go home and switch the heating off.</p><p>"That’s a big mistake. Their pipes freeze and the next thing you know their ceiling collapses.</p><p>"After that they usually pay someone locally to go in and keep an eye on things."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Feeling the freeze</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/braemar-aberdeenshire-people-used-low-864234097.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/braemar-aberdeenshire-people-used-low-864234143.jpg><p>Alasdair Colquhoun, 75, has run Lamont Sporrans in the centre of Braemar for the past two decades. The pipes freeze at the shop most winters, but he’s used to it.</p><p>Alasdair said: "It’s an old granite building with no insulation. It’s just what happens.</p><p>"All I do is switch the water off and wait for the pipes to thaw. There’s absolutely nothing else you can do."</p><p>He runs the business with his wife Bernadette and spends hours in the shop making bespoke sporrans, which go around the world.</p><p>The business also has a royal warrant for supplying the King when he was the Prince of Wales.</p><p>Alasdair is feeling the impact of the rise in energy prices, as well as the soaring cost of supplies for his custom-made products.</p><p>He added: "Everywhere you go you feel the squeeze. There’s only so much you can pass onto the customer.</p><p>All I do is switch the water off and wait for the pipes to thaw. There’s absolutely nothing else you can do</p><span class=quote-credit>Alasdair Colquhoun</span><p>"People come in here and expect to pay the same as they do on <a href=#>eBay</a> for a cheap sporran that’s come from <a href=#>China</a>, but that’s not going to happen.&nbsp;</p><p>"I can only afford to run this place with myself and my wife. We wouldn’t have the money to employ anybody else."</p><p>But despite the challenges, Alasdair reckons the positives far outweigh the negatives.</p><p>He said: "You only have to wake up and look out at the scenery in the morning and that makes everything worth it.</p><p>"And it’s nice to stay somewhere where you know everybody and say hello to everyone that passes you in the street."</p><p>The majority of businesses in Braemar are small, family-run affairs. It’s thought there are more jobs than potential workers.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the positions are at the cheaper end of the scale in the hospitality industry.</p><p>It’s not unusual for some residents to have two or three jobs at a time to make ends meet.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tough times</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/braemar-aberdeenshire-people-used-low-864234107.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/braemar-aberdeenshire-people-used-low-864234054.jpg><p>Every <a href=#>Christmas</a> Geva Blackett offers food and supplies to anyone in the area who’s struggling.</p><p>She teams up with local estates and businesses to make the essential deliveries over the festive seasons.</p><p>She said: "I don’t judge anybody. If somebody comes to me and tells me they need help, I give them help.</p><p>"People are having to think about how much it costs to switch on the oven. Last year a lot of families were saying they just couldn’t cope."</p><p>Geva was inspired to become a councillor after hearing about an apprentice at the local garage who couldn’t afford to stay in the area.</p><p>She is also determined to get young people to stay or move in to ensure there’s a future.</p><p>People are having to think about how much it costs to switch on the oven.
