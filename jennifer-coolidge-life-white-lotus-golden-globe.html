Unfortunately it's a terrible drug."</p><p>After a number of A&E dashes, she checked into a rehab facility in Minnesota and&nbsp;was sober by 27.</p><h2>'Bedded 200 men'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ac4bb7a8-6249-4f4e-a42c-3adb8c955dc3.jpg><p>Despite hating auditions, which gave her "full on anxiety attacks", Jennifer moved to LA to pursue her dream.</p><p>Her breakout role was as 'MILF' Jeanine Stifler - AKA Stifler's mom - in American Pie in 1999, followed by Paulette the manicurist&nbsp;in Legally Blonde in 2001, and Hilary Duff's mum in A Cinderella Story (2004).</p><p>But her promising career took a knock when she lost out to Felicity Huffman for the role of Lynette Scavo in Desperate Housewives in 2004.</p><p>Jennifer sensationally admitted she benefited from her lucrative American Pie role in more ways than one, telling Variety: “I got a lot of play at being a MILF, and I got a lot of sexual action from&nbsp;American Pie.</p><p>"There were so many benefits to doing that movie. I mean, there would be like 200 people that I would have never had slept with."</p><p>While she later admitted that figure was an exaggeration, she added: "It did sort of open up the world to a much broader group of handsome men – and younger men."</p><p>Speaking to Ariana Grande for an <a aria-label="Entertainment Weekly (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a> interview, Jennifer recalled an encounter with one "particularly young guy".</p><p>“I won’t get into the details," she said. "But afterwards, the next morning, I told him I needed to get a blow dry. So he was so young, we called his mother to see where I could get a blow dry.</p><p>“It was so weird that happened on the phone, it was very clear that we were in the bed together.”</p><h2>Marriage rumours</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jennifer-coolidge-stiflers-mom-american-509505486-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/47325dd8-b421-48a0-ac70-238dff82564a.jpg><p>Despite her candid sex confessions, Jennifer - who has never had children - is surprisingly private about relationships.</p><p>She was linked to Saturday Night Live's Chris Kattan after he wrote in his 2019 autobiography: "Jennifer Coolidge was a tall, messy, sexy, tough, charmingly crass Boston native bombshell."</p><p>There were rumours she married long-term boyfriend Tom Mahoney, although this was never confirmed.</p><p>In a 2021 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vulture</a>&nbsp;the actress revealed she was single, and that men are intimidated by her success.</p><p>She added: “I don’t want this to be the end of my life and my romance and all that. But I don’t know how people do it anymore.</p><p>"Sometimes I feel like you got this good little thing going once in a while with somebody. You get too much permission to, you know, be you.</p><p>"The thing dissolves pretty quick."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/5907cb9d-5b7d-4abd-949b-b0142c5e1afd.jpg><h2>Unlikely duo</h2><p>In 2018, Ariana Grande cast Jennifer in the music video for her track Thank U, Next.</p><p>Jennifer credits the singer with having a hand in her career "resurrection".</p><p>"I'm embarrassed because I just didn't have high hopes of things like this, you know what I mean? My life had been sort of flatlining for quite a while, so this is above and beyond, and it's a thrill," she told Ariana during an interview.</p><p>"I think it really started with you asking me to&nbsp;be in the 'Thank U, next' video.</p><p>"I mean, from there I got&nbsp;Promising Young Woman, and this whole thing. You were sort of the instigator. I really believe that."</p><p>While she described Legally Blonde as "a gift from god", Jennifer says it's her recent work she's most proud of because she "got to play more complicated people".</p><p>“I have done one thing really right in my life. I’ve picked great friends," she said.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“If [White Lotus director] Mike was never successful, and we just did White Lotus as a play in a little theatre where everyone paid 10 bucks to see it, it would still be one of the greatest things that ever happened to me.</p><p>"Because it was a killer job that no one else thought I could do."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/i-love-xox-thank-u-787808446.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NINTCHDBPICT000701713754.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhqYWV9d3%2BRcmajnZ6jtqex0WaaqKecnrGosYyloJ%2BdXay1qsDEZqOorKWoeqi7y52cp2WXobyjsY4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./leicester-zoo-mass-cull-government-bailout-coronavirus.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Leicester Zoo bosses warn of 'mass cull' unless it gets government bailout amid coronavirus outbreak">&larr;
