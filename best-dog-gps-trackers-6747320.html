If you worry about your furry friend wandering off, you can give yourself peace of mind by outfitting them with a GPS tracker. The best dog GPS trackers provide real-time location updates directly to your phone, allowing you to quickly find your pet and bring them home safely if they wander out of your yard or get lost while out hiking.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“GPS trackers have a lot of benefits,” explains Nicole Ellis, a certified professional dog trainer with Rover. “There is the obvious one of tracking our pets in the event they should get out, but there’s more than that. Quite a few GPS trackers will give you insights to your dog's health, from how much exercise they are getting to the amount of itching and licking going on.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you’re looking at different GPS trackers, you’ll want to consider things like the size of the tracker, its battery life, the tracking range, and whether it requires a monthly subscription. There are a wide range of products to choose from for your pet, and we tested more than a dozen of the top-rated dog GPS trackers to see which ones performed the best.&nbsp;We have to be honest: We have yet to come across the perfect dog GPS tracker, and we've outlined the pros and cons in detail below. We take our pet's safety seriously, and if you're reading this, you likely do, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These are the best dog GPS trackers PEOPLE Tested.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-jiobit-smart-tag-location-monitor></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jiobit Smart Tag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Jiobit Smart Tag Location Monitor" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/LFBiueMs92pzTDka_b6YoOzHUzo=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Jiobit-Smart-Tag-9dde340e77fb46dca123929f1f6daa17.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Accuracy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>The battery lasted 14 days before needing to be recharged.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The tracker sends real-time alerts if your dog leaves the geofenced area.</p></li><li readability=1><p>The app uses Google Maps, which means you can see landmarks, as well as your dog’s location.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Life360 is a popular location-sharing app used by thousands of people, and the brand now also sells GPS trackers for both children and dogs. We tested the Life360 Jiobit GPS Dog Tracker, and overall, we were impressed by the device’s easy setup, accurate alerts, and long-lasting battery, earning it the top spot as our best overall pick. The tracker has a teardrop shape and comes with a variety of clips so you can attach it to any collar, and the brand compares its size to an Oreo cookie, making it best-suited for medium and large dogs.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It was a straightforward process to pair this tracker with our smartphone, as it connects via Bluetooth, and from there, we were able to set up a profile and “geofence” for our pet. The geofence served as a virtual boundary, and we received push notifications when the tracker crossed the invisible line. (The very first time we tested the tracker, it didn’t send a notification, but it worked every time after that.) The GPS provides accurate real-time tracking updates, and we loved that the tracker’s location is displayed on Google Maps, which allows you to see street names and landmarks — handy if you’re trying to track down a lost pet. Plus, because the tracker uses a combination of GPS, cellular data, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth to keep tabs on your pet, there’s no limit to how far away you can track them.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Jiobit tracker’s battery lasted for 14 days during testing, which is significantly longer than most other models we tested. The unit does require a monthly subscription to operate, and if you pay on a month-to-month basis, it costs $14.99. However, if you sign up for a 6-month or 2-year contract, the price-per-month drops to $12.99 or $8.99, respectively. This price is fairly average for a GPS tracker, but we were a little disappointed that the app doesn’t offer any additional health insights, such as activity tracking or sleep data. Still, it was one of the best in terms of accuracy and ease of use, and it’s a worthwhile investment for any pet owner who wants peace of mind.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 37 x 50 x 12mm | <strong>Weight:</strong> 0.6 oz. | <strong>Battery Life: </strong>Up to 20 days | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Water-resistant, IPX8 | <strong>Subscription:</strong> $14.99/month</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-still-excellent-apple-airtag-4-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Still Excellent</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Apple AirTag 4-Pack</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Apple AirTag 4-Pack" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/xBTfeHTF_m8iqlx8pAfniXhw3iY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/apple-airtag-four-pack-1ac6d1aeab7742ef818ef1169f00d446.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>The tag paired with our iPhone in less than 30 seconds.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The AirTag was able to withstand being submerged in water for over a minute.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This tracker is one of the smallest and lightest options we tested.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=0><p>Once the tracker is out of range of your phone, its accuracy suffers.</p></li><li readability=0><p>AirTags can only be used with Apple phones, so this isn’t an option for Android users.<br></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After thorough testing, the good ol’ <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Apple AirTag</a> is another one of our top recommendations for a GPS tracker thanks to its ease of use, affordable price, and compact design. These round tracking devices are just over 1.5 inches in diameter and extremely lightweight, making them well-suited for both large and small dogs, and there are a wide selection of accessories you can use to attach the AirTag to your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>dog’s harness</a> or collar. Each AirTag costs less than $30, and it’s one of a few products that doesn’t have a monthly subscription fee, making it a budget-friendly choice.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We absolutely loved how easy it was to pair the AirTag to an iPhone. All you have to do is place the tag next to your phone, and it will sync up in a matter of seconds. It’s simple to operate using the Find My app, and it has the longest battery life of all the trackers we tested, lasting up to a full year. This is perfect if you want to attach the tracker to your dog’s collar and forget about it, as you won’t need to constantly take it off for charging.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Regarding accuracy, the AirTag was pretty good but not perfect. (You’ll see that none of the trackers we tested really wowed us with their accuracy.) If the tracker is within Bluetooth range of your phone, which is roughly 33 feet, the Precision Tracking feature will provide an exact location and allow you to ping the AirTag. However, we found that once it’s out of range of your phone, the accuracy suffers a bit as your phone works to locate it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While it is one of our top overall picks, that’s not to say the Apple AirTag is a perfect solution. The biggest downside of this tracker is that it’s only available for iPhone users—the tags can’t be paired with Android or Google phones, which may rule it out for many people. Additionally, because of how it works, this GPS tracker is most effective and accurate in locations where there are a lot of iPhone users around — a.k.a. a city or busy neighborhood. When the tag is out of your phone’s Bluetooth range, its signal is actually tracked by other nearby Apple devices, which confidentially transmit the location of your AirTag to iCloud. Essentially, you’re relying on other people’s iPhones to pinpoint your dog’s location. If you’re in a more rural location, such as a hiking trail, with no one else around, the long-distance tracking abilities are essentially rendered useless.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Apple AirTag was previously our top pick for a dog GPS tracker, but due to the Apple software limitations, the Jiobit outranked it during this round of testing. However, for the affordable price and ease of use, we think this is still an excellent choice for iPhone users.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 1.6 x 1.6 x 0.1 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 0.39 oz. | <strong>Battery Life:</strong> 1 year | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes, IP67 | <strong>Subscription:</strong> None</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-petfon-petfon2-smart-tracker></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Petfon Petfon2</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=799 data-sizes=750px alt="Petfon Petfon2 Smart Tracker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/xiDosAcxlV3XTkCkyDzkEvBwYOY=/fit-in/1500x799/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PetFon-Pet-GPS-Tracker-3f3f228800bc43398722024eac75ac30.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chewy</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Accuracy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=0><p>The live GPS location updates are accurate and displayed on a detailed map that includes street names.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The app includes training videos that are suitable for all ages.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The battery can last for several days if you don’t use the live tracking mode.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This tracker doesn’t require a monthly subscription fee.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you don’t mind spending a little more up front, the PETFON 2 is a non-subscription option that performed well during our tests, earning one of the highest all-around scores. It has a compact design that can easily be attached to your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dog’s collar</a>, and we were able to set it up in just a few minutes. We especially liked that there are comprehensive training videos that explain the different features of the tracker, and the brand has gone to lengths to ensure they’re accessible for users of all ages.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we tested this tracker, it displayed accurate locations, and the map is labeled with street names and other details that make it easier to pinpoint your lost pet. The tracker itself will also light up and/or play a ringtone to help you find it, and we like that you can customize both of these settings by selecting your preferred color and tune. The PETFON app also keeps track of data such as your pet’s daily steps, minutes of activity, and minutes of rest, and it keeps an accurate history of your pet’s location.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the brand lists this tracker’s battery life as 8 to 16 hours, we found that it lasts significantly longer if you don’t frequently use the live tracking mode. In our testing, it was able to go 10 days before needing to be recharged, but we did notice that it occasionally shut itself off without notifying us. When this happened, we often didn’t realize the tracker was off until we opened the app, and this could post an issue if it happens while your dog is wearing the device.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 42 x 42 x 18mm | <strong>Weight:</strong> 0.97 oz. | <strong>Battery Life: </strong>8-16 hours | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> No | <strong>Subscription:</strong> None</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-hiking-petfon-pet-gps-tracker></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Hiking</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Petfon Pet GPS Tracker</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1032 data-sizes=750px alt="Petfon Pet GPS Tracker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/_hfO2jJqPfVvvRz4JxowetzTsEc=/fit-in/1500x1032/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ScreenShot2022-09-16at3.42.04PM-2051242e58b24801bd79be4ef7a1be63.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Accuracy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>The tracker is compact and doesn’t seem bulky when attached to a collar.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This tracker has a range up to 3.5 miles in open outdoor spaces.</p></li><li readability=0><p>When it has a strong connection, the tracker provides frequent and accurate location updates.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>The battery life depletes quickly — it dropped 6% in the first 10 minutes of use.</p></li><li readability=0><p>This tracker sometimes loses its connection to the phone, sometimes for several minutes at a time.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re only planning to use your GPS tracker during short outings with your pet, the PETFON GPS Tracker is a solid no-subscription option. It does have a higher upfront cost, but it offers real-time GPS tracking with a range of 3.5 miles in open outdoor areas. (In dense city areas, the range drops to 0.65 miles.) The tracker comes with a band that you can attach to your dog’s collar, and we liked the sleek, compact design, which isn’t overly bulky, even on smaller dogs.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The PETFON Tracker has the shortest battery life of the products we tested, lasting just eight to 16 hours per charge, but it does come with a portable case that can recharge the tracker up three times. We think this tracker would be well-suited for activities like hiking, especially since it works best in open outdoor environments, but if you want it for daily use, you’ll likely need to charge it every day.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of accuracy, the PETFON GPS Tracker was one of the better options we tested. It does occasionally lose connection with the app, but overall, we found that its updates were more frequent and accurate than other trackers. The device has a light that you can turn on to help locate your pet at night, and while there’s also a feature that lets you ping the tracker, we found that it’s too quiet to be much help.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 1.7 x 1.7 x 0.6 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 0.97 oz. | <strong>Battery Life:</strong> 8-16 hours | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> No | <strong>Subscription:</strong> None</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-tracking-activity-fitbark-gps-dog-tracker-2nd-generation></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Tracking Activity</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>FitBark GPS Dog Tracker</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="FitBark GPS Dog Tracker (2nd Generation)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/LB5oeZor9tyyAm90T7_JNsiJ_HE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/FitBark-GPS-Dog-Tracker-76c2aece5ecb4ec39f320d83ef947687.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-text>Amazon.</span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Accuracy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=3.5><li readability=1><p>The tracker connects to three cellular networks for better GPS coverage, and its live tracking data is very precise.</p></li><li readability=4><p>The FitBark app collects health data like calories burned, steps, miles traveled, and more, and it sends notifications if your pet hasn’t reached their daily goals.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The device is smaller than most and fits comfortably on small-breed dogs.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=1><p>The tracker attaches to your dog’s collar with zip ties, which have to be cut off and replaced if you need to remove it.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It took several tries to connect this GPS tracker to our Wi-Fi network.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of all the GPS trackers we tested, the FitBark GPS 2nd Gen offered some of the best activity tracking features. In addition to keeping tabs on your dog’s location, this device tracks a variety of other health metrics, including your dog’s daily activity time, sleep score, and miles traveled, and you can even link the app to Apple HealthKit and set goals for yourself and your dog.

However, we didn’t like that the tracker must be connected to your dog’s collar using two zip ties — it took some trial and error to get the tightness right, and you also have to cut and replace them every time you need to take the tracker off. The good news is that the battery lasts for up to 60 days per charge, though it depletes much faster if you use the live tracking mode, which refreshes its location once per minute.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 1.85 x 1.18 x 0.59 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 16 grams | <strong>Battery Life:</strong> Up to 60 days | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Subscription:</strong> $9.95/month</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-large-dogs-link-the-link-smart-pet-wearable></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Large Dogs</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Link Link Smart Pet Wearable</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Link The Link Smart Pet Wearable" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/rH33NfMzpvWyhKS7sb57CDLP7gM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Link-Smart-Pet-Wearable-Tracker-c1040c23079e4100831557db786c3383.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Accuracy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=1><p>The tracker provides extremely accurate location data on Google Maps, making it easy to pinpoint your dog’s location.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The app logs activity data and can even differentiate between running and walking.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The app is user-friendly and easy to navigate — it’s similar to the Fitbit app.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For larger dogs, the Link Smart Pet Tracker is another worthwhile option. While the tracker itself is somewhat bulky, we found that this device offered extremely precise location data — it could even tell us what room of the house the dog was in! Plus, it displays the tracker’s location on Google Maps, allowing you to see street names and other landmarks to find your dog faster.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This tracker also captures a variety of additional health data, such as steps, miles traveled, and even time spent walking vs. running. You can also set daily fitness goals for your dog, if desired. The app has a very user-friendly design — it actually reminded us of the Fitbit app — and it’s easy to set up and navigate. The battery on the tracker itself only goes down about 5% on an average day, so it really only needs to be charged once a week.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Link Tracker is fairly expensive up front and also includes a monthly subscription fee, but like most devices, you get a discount if you opt for a longer contract.

This product is more compact than many other options we tested, and it comes with a handy rubber clip that makes it easy to remove from your dog’s collar for charging. It has an affordable upfront cost, but you do have to pay a $13 per month subscription fee to operate this tracker. The good news, however, is that it has unlimited range, so you can locate your pup no matter how far they’ve wandered.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During testing, we found that the Tractive wasn’t the best option in terms of real-time updates, sometimes struggling to find a signal, but it did create an accurate location history map. It’s automatically set to provide a location update every five minutes, but we liked that you can adjust this setting if your dog ever gets loose and receive updates more frequently—as much as every two to three seconds. The app also allows you to create virtual fences and will send you notifications if your dog wanders outside of them, and the tracking unit itself is completely waterproof, so you can leave it on your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dog's life vest</a> when he goes swimming.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 2.8 x 0.65 x 1.13 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 1.2 oz. | <strong>Battery Life:</strong> 7 days | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Subscription:</strong> $13/month</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-dog-gps-tracker></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying a Dog GPS Tracker</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Data Source</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are several different ways that GPS trackers gather location data. Some use cellular networks, some use GPS satellites, and others use both. “Depending on the location of your dog’s activities, collars that operate off cellular towers may not be an option, so you might need to consider one that runs off satellite,” explains Kait Hembree, Head of Training at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>GoodPup</a>. “Collars run off cellular towers are great for helping find lost dogs, but if you need to be able to monitor the movement of your dog, then a satellite GPS would be the better option.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are also some trackers, such as the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Apple AirTag</a>, which rely on Bluetooth connections to smartphones to provide location information.

You’ll want to think about how you plan to use the tracker to find the best fit for your needs. If you want to simply attach it to your pet's collar and leave it there, look for a product with a long battery life. However, if you only plan to use it during short outings, such as daily hiking trips, a shorter battery life might not be a big deal.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Features<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some of the GPS trackers we tested are specifically designed for pets, while others, like the AirTag, are general GPS trackers. Dog-specific trackers often have additional features that you may be interested in, such as activity or sleep tracking.
