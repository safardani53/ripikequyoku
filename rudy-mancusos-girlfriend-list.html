If it's something they're passionate about, they'll labor tirelessly until they achieve it. They have a long life full of vitality and wonder about the world. Relationships are important to monkeys as well. However, pampering children may be one of their flaws.</p><p>People born on February 28 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Pisces</strong>.

Pisces is the zodiac's most perceptive, sensitive, and empathic sign, and that's because it's the last of the last. Pisces, as the final sign, has absorbed every lesson taught by the preceding signs, including the pleasures and sorrows, hopes and anxieties. It is represented as two fish swimming in opposite directions, symbolizing Pisces' continual divide of attention between imagination and reality.</p><p>Web star who initially gained fame on Vine, finishing with over 10 million followers on his channel.
