Every bit of it. Even the bits that society says shouldn’t be there. Because EVERY bit of it came together to make him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Stacey documented her pregnancy journey with refreshing honesty, uploading videos of her pregnancy bump covered in hair (something I didn’t know could ever happen since no one had ever been brave enough to share an image like that before) and photos in which cellulite and stretch marks are visible for the world to see.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000513268398.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000472200268.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000485132235.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000489829489.jpg><h2>'No one can tell me not to wear a bikini'</h2><p><span><a href=#>Denise Welsh</a>, a 61-year-old mum-of-two, regularly shares photos of herself in a bikini on Instagram and, telling the </span><span>Mirror Online la</span><span>st year: “I’m doing it because there are a lot of women in this country who have self esteem issues, and a lot of it is to do with women’s magazines putting lots of pressure on women for how they look.</span></p><p><span>"I’m putting my money where my mouth is and saying that no one can tell me not to wear a bikini.”</span></p><p><span>She’s right.

We’re constantly sold diets, makeup and surgery all to keep us looking young and thin for as long as possible and as a result, a lot of us feel really negatively about our bodies.&nbsp;</span><br><span>It is thanks to women brave enough to do something about it, that the conversation can now start to change.&nbsp;</span><span>Sure, when you compare it to bomb disposal, stripping off for an Instagram picture in your bikini isn’t medal-worthy bravery.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But in sharing photos of themselves without makeup on, in bad lighting and adorned with cellulite, the </span><span><a href=#>Loose Women</a> </span><span>are helping to make women like me feel better about my body than I ever thought I could. So I’m very grateful to them for that.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And I hope that they continue to lead by example until all women, no matter their size and age, feel comfortable enough in a bikini to put uptight people everywhere off their breakfasts.&nbsp;</span></p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN TV & SHOWBIZ</h2></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Stacy Solomon introduces adorable baby Rex to the Loose Women ladies</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5hybGprYmh8o7vOm6pmmqWiwG6tzZ1ksKeSl7m6ecGiq6xlmKTEbsDHnmSlp5%2Bosm7Dzqacp2WcpMC1edOhnKKqXZi5sMDHnqpmmZ6ZeqityKecnWWdnrmttc6nqmanlmKzorrSaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dru-presta.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dru Presta">&larr;
