"Then dry it all off and after that you need to rub the door down."</p><p>This step is required for both the windows and doors you can use a scuff or sanding pad to do the job.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000644385203.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000644385192.jpg><p>This gets all the dirt, grime and gunk off the entire area leaving a clean canvas ready for paint.</p><p>If you're tackling your windows, or if your door has glass cut outs, the next step is to tape over the edges to ensure you don't paint the glass.</p><p>The Property Fixers use some brown sheet paper to cover the surface too as the spray paint often travels further - and then it's time to paint.</p><p>If you're using a spray gun on your windows or door, spray a few coats over the entire surface until you get you desired coverage.</p><p></p><p>If you're using a paintbrush, however, it's wise to let each coat dry before going in with another - which can take a little more time.</p><p>Showing off the new, modern windows, the renovation gurus say in the clip: "This is the finished results. That's looking pretty sexy. Just like that you have a brand new window."</p><p>As for Creative Crambo's door, it now features a modern grey hue after three coats of Frenchic paint, which he says he's "well pleased" with.</p><p>"What a difference a little bit of paint makes to a uvpc door," he says, admiring his new front door, although he wasn't expecting to have to do three coats.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000644387608.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000644387618.jpg><p>After the first coat he warns: "Don't be worried about it if it's looking a bit patchy, that's ok because you will get that in the second coat."</p><p>He suggests wait two hours between coats and says to give the door a quick rub down after each coat to help eliminate patchy spots.</p><p>He went in for a third just for good measure, but said it completely depends on your own door.</p><p>The whole lot cost him just £75, but that includes a new door knob, a new knocker and spray paint for the handle - turning it from a worn out brass to a chic silver.</p><p>Without these extra costs you can do it for even cheaper and the pain job alone is pretty impressive.</p><p>"Get yourself some nice paint, freshen up your door. The results are great," he says.</p><p></p><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Sunbeams – Britain’s biggest baby competition is back, with £1000 up for grabs!</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-11.png><p>BRITAIN’S biggest baby competition is back and we are looking for the King or Queen of the crèche.</p><p>The Sun is hunting for Britain's bonniest baby.</p><p>Not only could your child be crowned the cutest baby, there's also an £1,000 prize up for grabs.</p><p>Think your baby has a winning smile?
