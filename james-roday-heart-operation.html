The first season centered around a group of friends â€” including Eddie Saville (David Giuntoli), Rome Howard (Romany Malco), Katherine Kim (Grace Park), and Gary Mendez (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Roday</a> Rodriguez) in Boston as they grappled with the suicide of Jon Dixon (Ron Livingston).&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While trying to figure out what Jon was dealing with in the weeks leading up to his death, his friends are also going through trials and tribulations of their own.&nbsp;In Season 1, Gary was in remission from breast cancer, which is far less common with men than with women.</p><p>Viewers noticed that actor James Roday had a large scar on his chest, and some wondered what it was from. Did James Roday have a heart operation?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did James Roday have a heart operation?</h2><p>In Season 1 of A Million Little Things, Gary meets Maggie (Allison Miller) in a support group for cancer survivors. While the two immediately hit it off, she later finds out that he had used the group in the past as a place to meet women.&nbsp;</p><p>After arguing (and learning that Maggie's cancer had returned, aggressively), Gary decides to prove his commitment to her by showing her his scar from his mastectomy.</p><p>During this moment on the show, fans noticed that James Roday also had a scar on the left side of his chest.&nbsp;</p><p>Those who also used to watch the 44-year-old star on the USA comedy series, Psych, had previously seen that he had a long mark on his chest as well.</p><p>While it does not appear as if James has never publicly opened up about the scar, there are reports that he had open-heart surgery when he was 22. The size and placement of the scar on his chest matches one from that type of operation.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Because James has largely kept his personal life private, fans of the actor have found out information about him through other means.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2012, a person identifying as James' cousin posted a photo with the actor on<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Reddit.</a> One user responded to the photo with a question about James' chest scar.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Oooh, ooh! If you are his cousin: what is his giant scar from?" the user asked. "Some kind of heart surgery?</p><p>"Yes, he had a hole in his heart when he was a kid. Had it repaired and is the picture of health today," the original poster responded.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note that it is unclear if the Reddit user is actually related to James, and therefore, if the information about the actor's heart is accurate.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is James Roday dating?</h2><p>James has not shared whether or not he is in a relationship (he has active Twitter and Instagram accounts). He does share photos and videos of his on-screen love interest, Allison Miller, but the two have never indicated that they are dating.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>James's only known public relationship was when he dated his Psych co-star, Maggie Lawson, from 2006 to 2014. Maggie later married actor Ben Koldyke in 2015, but the pair divorced in 2017.</p><p>A Million Little Things airs on Thursdays at 10 p.m. on ABC.&nbsp;</p><p>You can stream all eight seasons of Psych on Peacock.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn66usdJmqaicka56qbHAq6tmp6Cav6LAyKil</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./israel-houghton-s-ex-wife-meleasa-houghton-know-their-reason-for-divorce.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Israel Houghton's ex-wife Meleasa Houghton; Know the Reason Behind their Divorce">&larr;
