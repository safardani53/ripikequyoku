However, it is known that his mother is Ozana Oliveira, and he grew up with his <a href=#>only sibling, Hermison Oliveira</a>.</p><p>Charles initially aspired to be a soccer player, but at age 7, he was diagnosed with rheumatic fever and a heart murmur which created difficulty for Charles in walking and sometimes lost mobility in his legs.</p><p>Doctors even warned that he could become paraplegic, a condition relating to&nbsp;paralysis&nbsp;of the legs and lower body.</p><p>Nevertheless, these setbacks fueled Oliveira’s desire to become successful. His parents also insisted on involving him in sports programs, and just after two years, he began to recover.</p><p>At 12, a neighbor named Paulo introduced Charles to Brazilian Ju-Jitsu, and soon after, he began training under Roger Coelho.</p><p>Unfortunately, Paulo died in a crossfire shootout in Vicente de Carvalho when Charles was 14.</p><p>Despite their unwavering spirit to enroll their son in a sports program, their financial instability took a toll on his parents. Nevertheless, the BJJ gym’s coach offered Charles free training through a social program.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Charles Oliveira garnered early success in Brazilian jiu-jitsu from 2003 to 2006. He then transitioned to MMA in 2007 and received his black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu in 2010.</p><p>He achieved a remarkable record of 12-0 in Brazil, showcasing a combination of submissions and knockouts.</p><p>In his amateur MMA debut, Oliveira quickly submitted Rui Machado with an armbar just 15 seconds into the first round.</p><p>Fast forward to 2023, and he has been in 44 total fights with 34 wins and nine losses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Charles-Beneil-Fight.webp><p>He was set to fight Beneil Bariush at UFC 288 on May 6, 2023, but had to withdraw due to injury.</p><p>He emerged victorious in the first round via TKO on the rescheduled bout for UFC 289 in the co-main event on 10 June 2023 at Rogers Arena in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.&nbsp;</p><p>This impressive win earned Oliveira his thirteenth Performance of the Night bonus award.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Charles Oliveira has been married to his wife, Talita Roberta Pereira, since 2014 and shares a daughter named Tayla Oliveira, who was born in 2017.</p><p>The happy family of three resides in Gauruja, where Charles actively participates in local charities.</p><p>He identifies as a Christian.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Charles-Wife-Talita.webp><p>Charles used to wear eyeglasses constantly in the past because of nearsightedness. Nevertheless, he was able to fight without them stating that it didn’t hinder him in the ring.</p><p>It was not until October 2022 that he revealed that he had undergone corrective eye surgery and now has 100% perfect vision.</p><p>Interestingly, in February 2023, Charles announced that he would join OnlyFans, to provide content to his fans, including his workouts, training regime, and more.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Wealthy Gorilla</a>, Charles Oliveira has an estimated net worth of around $5.5 million as of November 2023.</p><p>The majority of Oliveira’s wealth comes from his accomplishments in the UFC octagon.</p><p>In his highly awaited fight against Islam Makhachev at UFC 280 on October 22, 2022, Oliveira earned a base salary of $750,000.</p><p>In addition to his base pay, he received $500,000 from pay-per-view earnings and an additional $32,000 from promotions.</p><p>This resulted in a total earning of $1.29 million for the fight, making it a significant financial success for Oliveira.</p><p>On July 10, 2023, Charles scored the 20th finish of his UFC career, finishing Beneil Dariush in the first round.<br>The finish, which extended his own record for most stoppages in the UFC, also earned him a $50,000 Performance of the Night bonus.</p><h2>do Bronxs</h2><p>Oliveira’s nickname, “do Bronx,” has a unique origin.</p><p>It comes from the slang term “Bronx,” which is used to refer to favelas and impoverished neighborhoods.</p><p>In an interview, he explained that the nickname originated when he participated in an amateur tournament.</p><p>At the time, he was known simply as Charles Oliveira.
