Short of never leaving (tempting!), the cure to this heartbreak is being able to watch your pet from afar… via a pet camera. Even celebrities like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>JoJo Fletcher</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Brittany Snow</a> have been seen using the popular Furbo to keep an eye on their beloved dogs while they’re away.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Pet cameras are an extremely valuable tool for monitoring your pet while you're away, or even just out of the room,” applied animal behaviorist Lillian Ciardelli, ACAAB, tells PEOPLE. Many of the latest models come with features so you can watch and speak to your dog throughout the day, throw <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dog treats</a>, detect when they’re running around or barking, and so much more. “We use them often when working with pets who suffer from separation-related distress,” she says. “The voice and treat delivery features can be good for some dogs and contexts, but we don't recommend them for helping with separation training.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We compiled 17 of the most popular pet cameras available and tested them to see how well they would work for the average pet parent. Some setups proved simple while others caused minor challenges when connecting to apps. At the end of the day, we came away with our favorite seven easy-to-use pet cameras.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for the best pet cameras that PEOPLE Tested.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-eufy-pet-dog-camera-d605></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Eufy Dog Camera D605</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Eufy Pet Dog Camera D605" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/P2bT1oXQyvGHg_wPCN_0gHFv3aE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Eufy-Dog-Camera-D605-31a398c70b8f478998651cbc3b778c64.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Functionality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=0><p>Setup takes less than five minutes, including logging into the app<br></p></li><li readability=0><p>Has many extra features beyond camera, including a treat dispenser and two-way audio</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The 270-degree swivel lets you scan a whole room to find your pet</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The Dog Diary doesn’t require a subscription</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a pet camera that lets you watch your fur baby from afar, while talking to them, dispensing their favorite treats, and keeping track of their movements for a one-time price, look to the Eufy Pet Dog Camera. Connected using an app, this pet camera was a hit during testing. Setup involves a quick scan of a QR code, and a few steps on your phone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The camera, which comes with night vision and motion detection, proved effective and functional during our tests. The video was beautifully clear in both day mode and night mode. All of the controls (voice, treat, and motion) were highly responsive to commands from the app.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We appreciated the variety of features and noted how well each performed. The treat dispenser worked efficiently without spewing treats in every direction and the night vision went on automatically after the testing lab lights were turned off. With a 270-degree rotation, this camera provides a wide range of vision. Our team also appreciated how responsive the app was especially with screenshots and video recordings from the camera.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also liked the design, especially the classic white shell and medium size. You can easily store it on the edge of a table or counter to keep eyes on your pet. The only downside we noted was the higher price and that the pet camera can’t be mounted, but despite its cost, it’s a good value. Considering all of the features, the high resolution camera, and the interactive and responsive app, the Eufy camera more than earned our top spot among the best pet cameras.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">PEOPLE senior commerce writer Madison Yauger has had the Eufy Pet Dog camera for over six months. “I bought the camera to keep eyes on my newly adopted puppy and I have thoroughly appreciated all the features,” she says. “I like how it can swivel so you can scan a whole room if your dog is hiding in one corner or another, and the livestream keeps me at ease when I’m away — especially since it notifies you on your phone if your dog is moving or making noise.” She says the only con is that the activity log doesn’t always keep videos from throughout the day, which is frustrating if you want to go back and see what your pet was up to earlier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>View: </strong>270 degrees | <strong>Lens:</strong> 1080p wide angle | <strong>Treat dispenser:</strong> Yes | <strong>2-way Audio:</strong> Yes | <strong>Dog Diary: </strong>Yes | <strong>Subscription:</strong> No | <strong>App: </strong>Yes | <strong>Special Features: </strong>Night vision, motion sensor</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-yi-technologies-dome-pet-camera></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>YI Technologies Dome Pet Camera</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=640 data-sizes=750px alt="YI Technologies Dome Pet Camera" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/p_An0P-Mj0V9WGNUaki1VGXLNl4=/fit-in/1500x640/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/yi_pet_camera-91ce1910a9844d598def600aee236495.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Functionality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Instructions make for an easy setup of the device and the app<br></p></li><li readability=-1><p>High resolution video camera with HD and SD options</p></li><li readability=-1><p>360-degree view for full visibility</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This simple and compact camera is an affordable and well-designed device to watch your pets when you’re not home. The manual contained every instruction you need for an easy setup, and we found it easy to plug in the device and set up the app. For being a budget option, this camera actually exceeded our expectations.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With features like 360-degree monitoring and night vision, this camera will have eyes on your pet all day. We liked that the camera had clear video quality as well as options like HD and SD. We also appreciated the microphone aspect and how it provided clear audio when speaking to your pet. The actual device is super compact and portable, and our team loved all of the camera features. The camera’s affordability, high quality, and performance make it an impressive option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>View: </strong>360 degrees | <strong>Lens:</strong> 1080p wide angle | <strong>Treat dispenser:</strong> No | <strong>2-way Audio:</strong> Yes | <strong>Dog Diary: </strong>No | <strong>Subscription:</strong> No | <strong>App: </strong>Yes | <strong>Special Features: </strong>Night vision, motion sensor</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-treat-dispenser-furbo-360-dog-camera></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best with Treat Dispenser</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Furbo 360° Dog Camera</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Furbo Dog Camera" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/a6nS0dGqskSuHoAlCFwtspI4wxo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Furbo-Dog-Camera-9d89db154c494856a09b33062756666d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Functionality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Has a simple setup and interactive app<br></p></li><li readability=-1><p>The night vision is clear</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It has bark detection and motion sensors for dogs and people</p></li><li readability=-1><p>You can go back and look at the activity time log throughout the day</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As one of the most popular pet cameras, you might have heard of the Furbo. With a sophisticated design that blends into most spaces and features like motion- and bark-detection, night vision, treat dispensing, and two-way audio, this little camera has it all.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It takes very little time to connect to the internet, and the process to set up an account is just as simple. The model we tested had a 160-degree view, but has been replaced with a newer model with 360-degree mobility. We thought the video and audio quality were both great, including the night vision — and we appreciated the wide field of vision. The treat dispenser was a highlight, throwing two to four treats out with each swipe on the app, and there’s a guide to help you introduce this feature to your pet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, the Furbo is probably one of the best looking pet cameras we tried and felt very solid. However, our team noted that there’s no wall mounting support. If you opt in for <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the standalone camera</a> without the Dog Nanny Subscription, it costs a $210 flat fee, the most expensive price on our list. However, you can also buy <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a bundle package</a> with the base camera for $79 (with coupon) and the Dog Nanny Subscription (which lets you access videos of your dog throughout the day) for an additional $6.99 a month. Given all of the features and stunning design, we believe this is a great pet camera if you’re willing to invest.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yauger’s family has had the Furbo camera to watch their dog for a little over two years and for the most part, it has held up well. All of the features work as advertised, and the camera quality is fantastic. “Since I moved to New York and our family’s dog lives in Florida, I’ll check the Furbo every now and then to catch a glimpse of her and see what she’s up to,” says Yauger. Overall, it works really well, but it does go offline sometimes and has to be restarted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>View: </strong>160 degrees | <strong>Lens:</strong> 1080p wide angle | <strong>Treat dispenser:</strong> Yes | <strong>2-way Audio:</strong> Yes | <strong>Dog Diary: </strong>Yes | <strong>Subscription:</strong> Yes | <strong>App: </strong>Yes | <strong>Special Features: </strong>Night vision, motion sensor, bark detection</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-outdoors-wyze-cam-v3-with-color-night-vision></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Outdoors</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wyze Cam v3</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1500 data-sizes=750px alt="Wyze Cam v3 with Color Night Vision" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/9SdfDDWOa3NkqQKRzcvKsJeszKk=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/WyzeCamv3-02e5af1aacc24980866586d75a09babe.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li><p>It can be mounted<br></p></li><li readability=0><p>It’s weather-resistant, and can be used indoors and outdoors</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Can record 24/7 with sound and motion detection</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this security camera is basic in features, it offers resistance against inclement weather making it ideal as an outdoor pet camera. The setup is completely done within the app, so if you have a good Wi-Fi connection it shouldn’t take too long (though the instructions could have been clearer).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though limited in quantity, there are several features that impressed our team during testing. We liked that it can record video and take photos that can be saved on your phone.

Our team appreciated the ease of setup: Just download the app, scan a QR code, and the device connects automatically. The performance of the rest of the features — 2-way audio, motion detection, and treat dispenser — also proved efficient. If you have a cat at home, there’s an option of attaching a cat stick to the front of the camera for added entertainment.

We appreciated the clear quality of the video and audio features: We could even hear sounds of dogs barking nearby.

The notifications were almost instantaneous — it would be a good camera for security reasons as well as watching your pet, since there’s an alarm feature. Plus, the detailed notes about movement and time-stamped log makes it easy to access all that info later.

However, highly food-driven pets may try to dismantle the camera to get the treats out or obsess and stay glued to the spot where treats come from.”&nbsp;If your pet is already used to an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>automatic pet feeder</a>, then this shouldn't be an issue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The other side of this coin is when the pet is afraid of digital devices, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>robot vacuum cleaners</a>, so they run away when treats are dispensed. “If the pet is anxious about departures, it's unlikely to eat the treats anyway,” Ciardelli says. “Our goal is for pets to be relaxed while we are out of the house — not startled by a treat machine or vigilantly waiting for treats to be dispensed. The remote treat function can be a cool, creative training tool at other times (think dispensing treats to a dog behind a dog gate while the owner hosts a dinner party), it just shouldn't be relied on to help pets cope with being left alone.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Video Recording<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not all pet cameras have video recording capabilities, but many of the options on our list do. This feature, whether as a dog diary recap or as security footage sent to the cloud, can be a fun way to keep track of the comings and goings of your pet. For instance, with a Furbo, you can use the dog diary feature when traveling to see a recap of what your dog is up to throughout the day, rather than watching the feed constantly. This type of feature can also make for a good complement to a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dog GPS tracker</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some cameras have a specific feature like this that creates a summarized video of the day’s events, and others allow you to look through footage and save certain videos to an SD card or the cloud.

However, we prefer pet owners use other tools to prevent situations like that rather than rely on catching their pet in the act and shouting at them over the camera. It's best to use the camera to see what the pet gets up to when the owners are gone, and then create a better setup next time before they leave.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.98049414824447><p><span class=accordion__title>Do pet cameras record all the time?</span></p><p>Yes and no. Technically, they have the capacity to record 24/7, but most pet cameras are activated by motion-detection, meaning they won’t actively record unless you, someone else, or your pet are walking through the room. If you’re worried about privacy concerns — let’s say if multiple people in your family have access to your camera via the app —&nbsp;then you can always unplug the camera at certain times.&nbsp;</p><p>And like all smart home devices, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>video doorbells</a>, you want to make sure your Wi-Fi is secure to prevent potential hacks. For added security, make sure your Wi-Fi router has an encrypted password system, and consider measures like two-factor authentication and strong passwords that aren’t easily guessed.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Where should you place a pet camera?</span></p><p>This really depends on the space you live in. Some cameras have mounting capabilities which could come in handy in a smaller apartment or a space that has blind spots from certain angles, but it depends on your pet, space, and the type of camera you get. “In terms of placement, place [the camera] where you have the best view of the areas your pet is likely to hang out (usually high up is best),” says Ciardelli. “The camera should be out of reach, especially if dispensing treats. Make sure the treats don't launch onto a counter or skid under a table, otherwise you might come home to some destruction.”</p></li></ul><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>PEOPLE / LETICIA ALMEIDA</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested-pet-cameras></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested Pet Cameras</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Taking 17 of the top-rated pet cameras and a very cute stuffed animal dog, we simulated watching your pet from afar to see how well each device worked.
