My family is grieving, they don't need this.</p><p>"I don't want - especially on daytime TV - for her to be talking about my private sex life.</p><p>"She says she doesn't want to talk about me, or give me airtime but she continues to talk about me - it's disgusting.</p><p>"I don't want my family and my daughter - let alone her own kids - to hear this stuff.</p><p>"And I'm aware that my daughter [with Chantelle], Dolly, could potentially be bullied over this in the future.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2631563.main_image.jpg><p>"Furthermore, her ridiculing me is inciting prejudice and hate against trans people."</p><p>Alex also believes Katie's continuous references to his cross-dressing persona raises other moral questions that haven't been addressed.</p><p>"She's attacking Roxanne, and no one is defending her," he says.</p><p>Watching the show didn't just leave Alex feeling angry with his ex-wife, he believes that the whole panel needs a lesson or two about how best to deal with sensitive topics to do with sexuality and lifestyle choices.</p><p>He adds: "There were some sniggers from the panel, and that is very distressing to me and very upsetting. They need to speak from an educated standpoint.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2631530.main_image.jpg><p>"We're on the crest of a wave regarding trans-rights, and their reaction is damaging to the community, and to individuals dealing with their own<br>private struggles.</p><p>"Coleen Nolan said 'I'm not going to say anything or I'll get in to trouble' - well she's on a panel being paid to talk about a subject and now she won't talk about it?</p><p>"That to me is just as damaging.</p><p>"She's been given a position of power to discuss something. They're not the best types of people to talk about something like this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2631612.main_image.jpg><p>While Alex vetoes the idea of Roxanne joining the Loose Women panel, he is open to going on as himself to talk about his other life - but is adamant he doesn't want to physically become a woman.</p><p>He says: "I am a transvestite I do not want to be a woman permanently. I am an actor, I ike to dress up and pretend to be a woman, and why the hell not? Why can't I have fun? I like to be a man."</p><p>Alex also clarified comments he made in a recent interview that saw him reveal he identifies as "trans".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2627955.main_image.jpg><p>He explains that he sees himself as fluid, and to him the word trans represents 'transition' - sometimes he's Roxanne, sometimes he's Alex Reid.</p><p>Fans will soon get to know more about the two sides of his personality within the pages of his soon-to-be-released autobiography, and he will be fronting his own documentary series later this year.</p><p>And in a final swipe at his exes, he says: "I've never made one penny from the fact I'm a cross-dresser, but there are two women who have made a heap of money."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5Vpb2ppX5a5psSMq5yinF2grrW1xGanq6GTmnqnu9GcnJ1lnZp6tbuMnKamnV2kwrV5wKxkmmWkp66vv9Weqq2hpJp6p7vRZp%2Beql2kxK95xaKlmqaTnq6tecaaoKdn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./farrah-abraham-finally-addresses-rumors-shes-returning-to-teen-m.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Farrah Abraham Talks Return to Teen Mom OG, Spews Massive Amounts of Nonsense and Lies">&larr;
