He has an older brother named Corey.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ricky O’Donnell of SB Nation pointed out that Bynum isn’t solely a basketball player, as documented in Lee Jenkins’ 2011 Sports Illustrated feature.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He has a plethora of hobbies, most of which are unrelated to sports.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bynum’s childhood became a challenge of what he could disassemble and reassemble to “find out what the hell is going on.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bynum’s first love was electronics, which he used in everything from phones to laptops.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He was solely thinking about institutions where he could specialize in mechanical engineering – basketball wasn’t a front, but it wasn’t the only thing he was thinking about.</span></p><p><a href=#>Brandon Knight last played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Dallas Mavericks.

He spent most of his first year at Plainsboro, New Jersey’s West Windsor Plainsboro High School North.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Andrew went to Solebury School in Solebury, PA, for the rest of his first and second years.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He scored 9 points and grabbed five rebounds in the 2005 McDonald’s All-American game.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He had intended to join the University of Connecticut on a basketball scholarship; instead, the 17-year-old decided to enter the NBA straight away and declared himself eligible for the 2005 NBA draft, where the Los Angeles Lakers selected him.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Professional Career</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Los Angeles Lakers selected Bynum with the 10th overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft. He was 12 days younger than Jermaine O’Neal, the previous youngest player picked by an NBA franchise, at 17 years and 244 days.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>When the Lakers won their second consecutive title in 2010, Bynum was an even more significant part of the puzzle, generally staying healthy and scoring a career-high 15 points per game.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bynum had his best season two years later, earning his first and only NBA All-Star selection while averaging 18.7 points and 11.8 rebounds.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, <span>worries about his maturity</span> and attitude became an issue, and his career fell apart.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/andrew-bynum-career.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>At 24 years old, Andrew Bynum was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in August 2012 as part of the four-team transaction that brought <a href=#>Dwight Howard</a> to Los Angeles.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Andrew played 24 games with the Cavs before being prohibited in December 2013 for conducting harmful activity to the team.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It arose from shooting the ball every time he touched it in practice, regardless of how far away from the basket he was.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In January 2014, he was dealt with the Chicago Bulls and waived to free salary-cap space.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>There have been countless stories about Andrew Bynum making a comeback attempt since he last played in the NBA. But nothing has ever taken a severe turn.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Andrew Bynum | Body Features&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bynum possessed the whole package for a center at 7′, with strength, mobility, and a low-post game.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The idea that basketball may be the most viable career is popular when you’re built like a tower, 7-feet and 285 pounds like Andrew.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Andrew is a fragile individual whose frame has failed him. Someone appeared to be on the verge of breaking the all-time rebounding and blocked shot records but couldn’t manage his own body’s disintegration.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, he was removed from a collegiate “find yourself” period, where introversion and risk shaped his temperament.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Andrew Bynum | </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Injury&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Andrew Bynum’s knee ailments had plagued him since he was 12 years old, but the youngster was getting better with each passing year.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bynum had Orthokine treatments on both knees about a week before training camp to help his arthritis recover.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After experiencing knee soreness at the outset of camp, the 76ers chose to keep Bynum out of basketball workouts for three weeks as a precaution. He also had a bone injury in his right knee, unrelated to his therapies.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Before the season, he did not practice or play with the squad, and he suffered another setback when his left knee was injured while bowling.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to reports, Bynum’s knees had begun to degrade after not playing since the end of February.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>With swelling on his right knee, he admitted on March 1 that he might not be able to play by the conclusion of the season but said his left knee was healthy.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bynum underwent season-ending arthroscopic surgery on both knees on March 19, concluding his time with the 76ers without appearing in a game.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Clash with Kobe Bryant&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In the 2011-12 season, Andrew was an All-Star, but his career suddenly plummeted. He had a falling out with&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Kobe Bryant</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, and the Lakers traded him to the 76ers in 2012.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Without Andrew, the Lakers would have been much more susceptible. On the other hand, Bryant never entertained the concept of the young center being ruled out.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>When questioned about his thoughts about hearing of Bynum’s injury, he gave a straightforward answer. “Welcome to the club.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/andrew-and-kobe-1024x1024.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In addition to his persistent knee issues, he has faced questions about his maturity and motivation throughout his career.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He concluded that Kobe’s presence may have hampered his growth after spending an entire segment, arguing that Bryant’s presence benefitted him “tremendously.”</span></p><p><a href=#><strong>Shawn Long</strong> is an American-born professional basketball player who plays for the Levanga Hokkaido in the B.

For Bynum’s third season, the team exercised his rookie option, worth $2.1 million.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Eventually, Bynum chose to accept a one-year, $1 million contract with the Pacers, but he only played in two games for the team.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bynum made $70.1 million during his NBA career, split between four teams.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Awards & Achievements</span></h2><ul><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>2× NBA champion (2009, 2010)</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>All-NBA Second Team (2012)</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>NBA All-Star (2012)</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>McDonald’s All-American (2005)</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Third-team Parade All-American (2005)&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Social Media Presence&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Andrew Bynum is not active on social media accounts.
