She later died at the hospital.</p><h3>Olivia Benson</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/mariska-hargitay-captain-olivia-benson-789963253.jpg><p>For years, fans have been watching the <a href=#>sexual tension between Benson and Stabler</a> build on-screen.</p><p>Throughout the show's history, they have opened up about their feelings several times, but after Stabler left, fans gave up hope of them ever being together.</p><p>However, the hope was restored after Stabler returned and Kathy died.</p><p>Since the premiere of OC, Stabler and Benson have had several intimate scenes, but they have yet to act on their feelings.</p><p>The closest they got was during season 24, episode 12, when Benson asked for Stabler's help bringing home her son Noah after she sent him away to protect him during a gang attack.</p><p>"There's nobody that I trust more to bring my son home in one piece than Stabler," she tells ADA Sonny Carisi (<a href=#>Peter Scanavino</a>).</p><p>After arriving home, Stabler and Benson&nbsp;<a href=#>share a moment and almost kiss</a>.</p><p>"Elliot I want to," Benson says, "I want to, but I can't."</p><p>After he asks her why, she explains "Because what if it doesn't work out?"</p><p>Stabler then says "And what if things work out?"</p><p>Benson adds that she's "not ready for this"&nbsp;but establishes that she does "want" more with him.</p><h3>Angela Wheatley</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/organized-crime-inferior-product-episode-653328317.jpg><p><a href=#>Angela Wheatley</a> (Tamara Taylor) is a <a href=#>Columbia University</a> math professor and the ex-wife of crime boss Richard Wheatley.</p><p>During the first two seasons of OC, the sexual tension between her and Stabler grows, and they even shared a kiss during season 1, episode 5.</p><p>However, later on, it's revealed that he took out the hit that killed Stabler's wife.</p><p>Two episodes later, she then gets into an argument with her ex-husband after he informs her that she's not the love of Stabler's life, despite her efforts to seduce him.</p><p>Wheatley then alludes to the fact that Benson is "the one true love of his life."</p><h2>How many kids does Elliot Stabler have?</h2><p>There is no question that Stabler is a family-oriented man. He has proven time and time again that he will do anything to protect his family, which is why they have played a huge role in his return.</p><p>Throughout the course of his complicated marriage, he welcomed five kids: Maureen (Erin Broderick), Kathleen (Allison Siko), twins Richard "Dickie" Stabler (Jeffrey Scaperrotta) and Elizabeth "Lizzie" Stabler (Kaitlyn Davidson), and Elliot 'Eli' Stabler, Jr (Nicky Torchia).</p><p>As the years went on, fans saw less and less of Maureen and the twins, but Kathleen continued to play a prominent role in the SVU franchise.</p><p>She and Eli have also been seen in several episodes of OC. Stabler's other kids also make a few appearances throughout the seasons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/special-victims-unit-payback-episode-792580272-1.jpg><h2>How can I watch Law & Order: Organized Crime?</h2><p>Keeping up with all the Law & Order drama can often be hard because of all the crossovers.</p><p>However, NBC has made it easier for fans by airing the episodes back to back during Law & Order Thursdays.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Fans can first watch the original&nbsp;<a href=#>Law & Order</a>&nbsp;at 8pm EST, then SVU at 9pm EST, and OC at 10pm EST.</p><p>All three shows can also be streamed on <a href=#>Peacock</a> with an active subscription.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvYm2GeYCSaJylpJmkwW6%2F05qZpZ2iYsC3wYylmLBln6expr6Mq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnrGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./man-found-6million-storage-unit-auction-incredible-twist.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="I found 6MILLION inside 390 storage unit I bought at auction and there was an incredible twis">&larr;
