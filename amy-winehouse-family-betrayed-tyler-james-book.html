They thought he was the one person they thought would never cash in on her fame.</p><p>The book, My Amy: The Life We Shared, was published last week, but a family source tells me: “Tyler had been close since his early teens and they considered him one of their own. But they weren’t told or ­consulted about this book.”</p><p>The insider added: “They are particularly upset that Tyler has been claiming to be the only friend left who was not paid to be around Amy towards the end of her life, but many of her closest pals including her fiancé Reg Traviss are totally missing from his story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000657068132-1.jpg><p>“After all the financial support that Amy and her family gave Tyler, to hear these claims from him has left a bad taste in the mouth.” The family are outraged at what they say is a false picture of Amy, who died aged 27 on July 23, 2011.</p><p>They do not recognise the singer that James portrays in the book — details of which have infuriated Amy’s family, including his suggestion he was the only person close to her trying to help her beat her demons.</p><p>The source added: “Key ­people in her life have just been left out. Tyler paints ­himself as the only one trying to help Amy while others exploited her.</p><p>"He says Amy was on anti-depressants from 14 years old — it’s just not true — and there’s even a part where he says Mitch was upset that she had duetted with Tony Bennett.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3e92f3bc-fc42-44a8-934e-2715ca8c6afc.jpg><p>“In fact, he was thrilled. Tony was a hero for them both and Amy said she chose the song because it was her father’s favourite. Tony and his family remained friends with the Winehouses afterwards. The tenth anniversary is going to be a difficult enough time, and this just makes it worse.”</p><p>Amy’s family point to other claims in the book they say are plain wrong — even including details of her funeral.</p><p>A spokesman for the Wine-houses confirmed: “Amy’s parents are disappointed that Tyler has gone ahead with this book without consulting them, and dispute many of his claims.”</p><p>As the tenth anniversary approaches, it feels the perfect time to celebrate Amy’s short life. Here’s hoping her family do not have to suffer yet more heartache, from people using the milestone as a chance to cash in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000185485095.jpg><h2 class=has-text-align-center>RITA’S OUT ORA NIGHT LONG</h2><p>RITA Ora was up to her neck in celebrities at her latest party – just like the dress she wore for it.</p><p>The Hot Right Now singer wore the see-through outfit for her pal Vas J Morgan’s Pride celebration in Los Angeles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000660013363.jpg><p>Also in attendance were Demi Lovato, Ashley Benson, Paris Jackson, Adam Lambert and Jess Glynne.</p><p>Rita and Vas posted videos of the bash on Instagram as they drank LGBT-themed ­cocktails and enjoyed an extravagant dinner.</p><p>The night before she had been at another event, hosted by ­rapper Common.</p><p>It’s amazing she has time for ­partying as she is currently working on new music with Charli XCX and Sigala.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>ROMEO’S GOTA LICENCE TO CHILL</h2><p>MOST kids who turn 17 and get their ­driving licence count themselves lucky if they get any old car.</p><p>But for Romeo Beckham not only is his first motor a pricey number but his insurance is eye-wateringly high.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000659902634-2.jpg><p>The son of David and Victoria took his Maserati Levante, with prices starting at £58,000, out for a spin in London with pop star pal HRVY.</p><p>To insure the vehicle – a standard Levante has a 3.0-litre V6 engine with 345 brake horsepower – would set him back around £25,000, just a few grand shy of the national average wage of £31,461.</p><p>And that’s after he has managed the almost impossible tasking of finding a company bold enough to give him a quote.</p><p>It’s hardly Simon’s yellow Fiat Cinquecento on The Inbetweeners.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000659902628-1.jpg><p>An insider said: “We all know who bought that car. The bank of mummy and daddy was very generous with that deposit. It’s quite mad as Romeo is 18 and only recently passed his driving test.”</p><p>Despite the stress of driving through the capital’s busy streets, the youngster looked relaxed in cargo trousers, a black T-shirt and baseball cap that covered up his bleach-blond hair. He completed the pose with a silver chain necklace and earrings.</p><p>Meanwhile former England captain David was spotted by a group of Scottish fans in Mayfair, West London.</p><p>One supporter, who nabbed him for a picture, told him to stick a £10 bet on Lyndon Dykes netting against England last night. The fan said: “Told David to put a tenner on a Lyndon hat-trick.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>James’ weigh forward</h2><p>JAMES Corden has revealed he is not half the man he used to be since dieting, telling US shock jock Howard Stern: “So far I have lost about 35lb or a bit more.</p><p>“I feel like I’m getting better but there’s still a way to go. I’m trying to work out but I suck at it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000658056294.jpg><p>“It’s terrible. There are so few hours in the day that are just my own.”</p><p>The Late Late Show host previously told how he had taken up running, lifting weights and eating healthy chickpea pizzas.</p><p>He added: “I’ve got three young kids. We have the show and all these things. I feel like, ‘Hang on. I’ve got an hour when I’m on my own, and I’m doing something I absolutely hate. I should just be lying down’.</p><p>“I can do nothing like lying on a couch and staring at the corner of a rug.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>ZARA RAINS IN HER BIKINI</h2><p>I’M guessing that Zara McDermott took this ­picture a few days ago, because the sky is blue and there’s not a drop of rain to be seen.</p><p>Right now at Bizarre HQ it seems like the downpour is never ­ending.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000659989756.jpg><p>Nevertheless she let down her blonde locks and got her bikini out for a back ­garden shoot for her latest Instagram post.</p><p>She and boyfriend Sam Thompson recently revealed they are moving into his mum’s house while they make changes to their South West London home.</p><p>The Made In Chelsea and Love Island star wore the nude-coloured swimsuit from beachwear firm ­Calzedonia.</p><p>Zara said: “Bikinis in UK ­weather? Yes please.” I quite agree, Zara.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>It’s Baby to Booby</h2><p>WHEN the Spice Girls reunite again, Emma Bunton will have a new nickname to replace Baby Spice – Booby Spice, after her chest swelled when she was pregnant with son Beau in 2007.</p><p>Emma recalled thinking of the name with partner Jade Jones as she breastfed their new baby: “We came up with it in the hospital and my boobs had ballooned to epic proportions with the milk coming in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000658124123.jpg><p>“From that moment on, I was Booby Spice.”</p><p>She told the Sweat, Snot And Tears podcast: “It is odd when you think about it – the way other people react to women feeding their babies.</p><p>"There’s nothing more natural than a woman feeding her baby.</p><p>“Let’s face it, it’s not like a pair of boobs is anything new these days. Boobs are everywhere.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>NOEL ON A ROLL</h2><p>CONGRATS to the brilliant Noel Gallagher on a well-deserved No1 with his band High Flying Birds' first best-of collection.</p><p>In an era dominated by mediocre pop, it shows there’s still a healthy appetite for rock ’n’ roll.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/89ce6107-5ea7-4dec-9d91-acb9d3fea6c2.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Bizarre</h2></p><p>Boosted by two great new tracks, We’re On Our Way Now and Flying On The Ground, the ex-Oasis rocker also put in a solid shift on the promo trail with a series of belting interviews, including one with The Sun in which he shared his thoughts on the warring royals and gobby brother Liam.</p><p>Today’s pop stars should take note.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">SINGLES</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000652777279-1.jpg><li><strong>Good 4 U </strong>– OLIVIA RODRIGO</li><li>Save Your Tears – THE WEEKND</li><li>Kiss Me More – DOJA CAT ft SZA</li><li>Heartbreak Anthem – GALANTIS, DAVID GUETTA & LITTLE MIX</li><li>Deja Vu – OLIVIA RODRIGO</li><li>Oliver Twist – ARRDEE</li><li>I Wanna Be Your Slave – MANESKIN</li><li>Traitor – OLIVIA RODRIGO</li><li>Good Without – MIMI WEBB</li><li>Confetti – LITTLE MIX</li><ul><li><strong>EUROVISION winners MANESKIN enter the Top Ten singles chart with I Wanna Be Your Slave.
