Jennings was a great goalie of his day, and he was paid well by every club he joined. Patrick Anthony Jennings CBE was born in North Ireland on June 12, 1945. Patrick is widely regarded as one of the finest goalkeepers of all time because of his aggressive posture in one-on-one scenarios. He is one of the rare players who has played for two of the Premier League’s greatest rivals (Arsenal and Tottenham).</p><p>Patrick is also regarded as a legend because, while playing as a goalie, he was able to score a goal against Manchester United in the 1967 FA Charity Shield.&nbsp;Jennings was composed and secure, and his positional knowledge meant that he seldom needed to apply pressure. He just happened to be in the right place at the right moment to intercept crosses or deflect shots.&nbsp;Patrick was awarded the MBE in 1976, the OBE in 1987, and the CBE in 2023 in appreciation of his achievements in soccer.</p><h2>Pat Jennings Net Worth And Salary</h2><p><strong>Pat Jennings’ net worth</strong> is estimated to be between $2 -3 million dollars after accounting for his complete career earnings and assets. Pat has been a renowned goalie since he was a child. However, life has not always been rainbows and sunshine for him.&nbsp;With an 11-member family, it was vital for him to contribute as well. He dropped out of school when he was 15 to work in the linen industry. He’d make $14.89 a week there.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pat-Jennings-1.jpg alt="Pat Jennings" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Pat would take this money and place it on the table beside his mother. He joined the Irish Youth Team as soon as he realized his affinity for soccer.&nbsp;The athlete was just 17 years old and made $28.12 each week. He claims, however, that he would have played for nothing.&nbsp;Tottenham contacted him and offered him $42.79 per week to take him away from Watford. A figure that the player was already making with incentives in Watford.</p><p>Tottenham transferred him to Arsenal in 1977 for a cut-off fee of $48901.40. They were concerned that he may quit the club for free.&nbsp;This was due to a law that stated that once a player had been with a team for five years, they were free to leave.&nbsp;In addition, he was making $18338.02 each year with the Spurs. His new contract with Arsenal would pay him $24450.70 per year.</p><h2>After the recent collapse, Belfast honors Pat with a statue.</h2><p>Pat attended the unveiling of his monument in his hometown of Newry. This came after medical personnel took him to the hospital when he became unwell during a match between Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur.&nbsp;According to reports, Pat slumped in the bleachers and was quickly attended to by the stadium’s medical personnel.</p><p>The event occurred on Tuesday, and physicians immediately said that he was in stable condition the following day. They had allowed him to attend the inauguration of his monument in Belfast. Former Northern Ireland players Billy Hamilton and Gerry Armstrong, as well as ex-Tottenham great Ledley King, were also in attendance.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pat-Jennings-2.jpg alt="Pat Jennings" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He pondered on his extraordinary 60-year football career and stressed the importance of the statue’s location in his community.&nbsp;His wife Eleanor and children, as well as other family members, attended the ceremony. A local singer wrote a song in Pat’s honor and to commemorate the event.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGinmqxdn7KvusinnqxlnprBbsPOq6uhZZikxG6%2ByJyfZqGjYrWmecSxp6Wnopp6qbXSZpyaqp6eu6i%2FjJqlnWWjlrmivtho</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./trading-spaces-original-cast-where-are-they-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Trading Spaces Original Cast: Where Are They Now?">&larr;
