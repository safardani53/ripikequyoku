Kristin was screaming and crying on the ground and they were both clearly in pain not able to move. The car was gone and someone else called 9-1-1 by the time I got there but the bike was in multiple pieces and part of the car was shattered on the ground."</p><p>Cops confirmed to The Sun that they have no suspects as the vehicle escaped the LAPD after a brief pursuit near Universal Studios.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-14-at-11.55.31.png><p>The social media influencers were rushed to hospital following the collision, which they believe was intentional, and both underwent surgery after sustaining injuries to their legs.</p><p>Kristin and and Marcus shared an update with their fans on Instagram as they took their first steps since the accident.</p><p>He wrote: "I’m waking with a walker! Your prayers are working! <a class=notranslate href=#>@kristinjohns</a> did her physical therapy today and was able to sit up. The doctors said that this is actually very good for next day after a femur surgery ...</p><p>"Pain for both of has been up and down. Best and worst it’s been so far. Just taking a day at a time."</p><p>And Kristin added: "This afternoon I was able to take about 5 steps which is CRAZY! I am so motivated to get up & walk with a walker because then we can go home & be with family."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-14-at-11.54.33.png><p>The pair also said they believed the suspect crashed into them on purpose.</p><p>Marcus explained more about the accident in detail earlier this week and said they believe that the person who hit them was trying to flee police following a burglary and purposely "tried to kill them".</p><p>The 27-year-old shared: "Me and @kristinjohns are ok! Nothing is official yet, but this is what we think has happened: We were on the far side of the road with other bikers and pedestrians.</p><p>"It is a residential neighborhood with multiple stop signs and speed bumps back to back over a short distance.</p><p>Adding: "I look down the road and heard an engine revving all the way up and it seemed like in the moment the guy was trying to hit us on purpose.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-14-at-11.55.42.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000582743916.png><p>"I said to Kris 'what is this guy doing!?' He was driving erratically and swerving towards us. I tried to swerved out of the way but he just followed us to hit us."</p><p>"I blacked out until I got to the hospital. So after I don’t know what really happened."</p><p>Marcus, who explained that the couple hope to be walking again in four months, said he was "unresponsive on the concrete" until the ambulance arrived.</p><p>"Sadly Kristin was fully conscious and had to watch me unresponsive on the concrete till ambulance arrived for us," he continued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000582743741.jpg><p>"Kristin said we flew about 50 feet from the impact.</p><p>He shared: "When I woke up and was trying to explain what happened, and I didn’t think people would believe me that I was convinced he was trying to actually kill us.</p><p>"But now it all makes sense if the robbery and police pursuit is officially confirmed. Anyways, scary stuff."</p><p>The social media star then asked their followers to "keep us in your prayers" and is glad they are now safe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000582744553.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN ENTERTAINMENT</h2></p><p>He concluded: "Surviving this was nothing short of a miracle."</p><p>The couple, who married in 2017, is best known for their YouTube videos - with Kristin focusing on lifestyle and beauty, while Marcus on sports and comedy.</p><p>Together the pair have over than 1 million YouTube subscribers, and a current total of over 80 million views.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwYm1%2BdYOOsqaurKWXsrN5yqugrKyZo3qru8enqmagmal6orrDZqmupl8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chris-evans-dog-matching-knives-out-sweater.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Evans Gets His Dog a Matching Knives Out Sweater">&larr;
