You would just assume open gates, open car park.</p><p>"I was pretty p***ed off at this point, I was just thankful that he came and got me out."</p><h2 id=parking-mad>PARKING MAD</h2><p>But a month late later, Georgie was <a href=#>slapped with a £100 fine</a>, reduced for fast payment, from Parkingeye in the post.</p><p>She said: "To be honest, I didn't think anything of it. I didn't expect to get a fine at all.</p><p>"There were around five cameras inside that showed I was stuck, it was completely out of my control."</p><p>The company claimed that as she had entered into an agreement to use the lot for one hour when buying her ticket, the extra hour she remained trapped inside was a "breach of contract".</p><p>The 28-year-old slammed the fine as "unfair and outrageous," adding: "At the end of the day it's 60 quid - it's not the be all and end all, but out of principle I was just like 'no, I'm not paying'.</p><p>"I think it is absolutely outrageous that they are making me pay a fine to be trapped inside."</p><p>She also slammed the suggestion that she should have <a href=#>bought more tickets</a> to cover the time she spent trapped inside.</p><p>I think it is absolutely outrageous that they are making me pay a fine to be trapped inside.</p><span class=quote-credit>Georgie Lamburt</span><p>Georgie said she initially complained to Parkingeye, who turned her appeal down.</p><p>And after appealing the charge through Parking on Private Land Appeals (POPLA) her bid to dodge the fine was REJECTED, she said.</p><p>But since being contacted by The Sun, Parkingeye said that Georgie's Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) will be cancelled.</p><p>A spokesperson for Parkingeye told The Sun: "The car park at Lee Valley Hockey & Tennis Centre is monitored by ANPR camera systems and has prominent and highly-visible signage that gives motorists clear guidance on how to use the car park responsibly.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“During October, the centre’s operating hours was 12 midday to 10pm and the motorist received a Parking Charge Notice for parking outwith these hours. However following a review of the case we have cancelled the PCN as a gesture of goodwill.</p><p>“Parkingeye operates a BPA (British Parking Association) audited appeals process, which motorists can use to appeal their Parking Charge Notice. If anyone has mitigating circumstances, we would encourage them to highlight this by appealing to Parkingeye.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/03575a53-b7a6-44c0-bf7e-233898592ade.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000713856296.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000713856372.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxyg5ZsaGtuYGSzqrrEnWRqaGBisKK%2BjKmYq6Ndqb%2BivM%2Bem2ahnmQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sian-lilly-19980312-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sian Lilly (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr;
