He attended Keene High School and played football there.</p><p>Later, he received a full athletic scholarship, the last available scholarship to play football for the Boston College Eagles, and it was a God-sent for him.</p><p>Speaking in the Miami’s dolphins podcast, John said, “Getting out of Keene was a great opportunity for me.”</p><p>He played football starting his sophomore year at Boston College and appeared on the football radar. John also played in one of the most famous football games, the Orange Bowl.</p><p>By the mid-1980s, John stood out as one of the top defensive linemen in the college.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, John was selected by the Miami Dolphins in the first round of the 1987 NFL Draft, and his career took off.&nbsp;</p><h2>Career</h2><p>The first year at the Dolphins went pretty well for John. He was naturally a grinder and would never miss a day at practice.</p><p>The former NFL player was named the team’s outstanding defensive lineman in 1987 after leading the line with 50 tackles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/john-bosa-receiving-defensive-rookie-trophy-for-his-son-nick-1666529669.jpg><p>After a promising rookie year, John Bosa had 17 tackles and two sacks in the first five games of 1988. However, in the second half of 1998, his injuries started.</p><p>Following his injuries, his career went downhill, and he never recovered. Bosa’s career had started with a lengthy contract holdout, costing him valuable practice time in training camp.</p><p>Then, with his injuries, the condition worsened, and he could barely progress.</p><h3>Injuries</h3><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Nick Bosa</a>‘s Father, John Bosa’s first injury was on September 26, 1998, when he pulled a groin muscle in a game against Minnesota.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, on October 16, 1988, John injured his left knee and tore his ligaments and cartilage in a game against San Diego. Because of it, he was removed from the Dolphins’ practices for ten months.</p><p>Bosa returned from the injury in August 1989 and joined his teammates. However, he frequently suffered pain throughout the training sessions.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Untitled-design-2.png><p>He was decked out in shorts, shoulder pads, and a titanium brace running from his thigh to his calf and designed to give maximum protection to a knee. Moreover, his weight dropped from 275 pounds to 255.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the retired NFL player again hurt his right knee on August 5, 1990, in a game against Tampa Bay.&nbsp;</p><h3>John Bosa: A Bust&nbsp;</h3><p>Nick Bosa’s Father, John Bosa, had an injury-plagued NFL career. Unfortunately, he had to spend more time with doctors and therapy centers than with the players in the field.</p><p>During his time in the field, John rarely showed his potential to the audience. But he made little improvements while playing for the Dolphins.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, John received many boos, taunts, and scathing insults from fans and the local media. He was called out as a bust.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with Dolphins, John said, “I don’t think I would have stayed a bust if I had remained healthy.”</p><p>He further added that he wanted to play a lot and had different dreams, but the injuries were devastating, and the medical technologies back then didn’t help him recover quickly.&nbsp;</p><h2>Retirement And Post Retirement&nbsp;</h2><p>Nick Bosa’s father’s NFL career lasted only three seasons. John played for the Miami Dolphins as a defensive end and officially retired from his football career in 1989.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nick-Bosas-Father-John-Bosa-Black-and-White-Picture.jpg><p>Though his football career didn’t serve him well to John, his life after football has been fulfilling.&nbsp;</p><p>John invested his earnings in local real estate and businesses. He also started his gym with Eric Kumerow. It soon became a big success and came out as one of the best fitness facilities in South Florida.</p><p>Furthermore, John and Kumerow eventually sold the gym and got a significant return on their investment.</p><p>We can also say that Nick Bosa’s Father’s gym immensely helped Nick and Joey from an athletic and health viewpoint.&nbsp;</p><h2>Wife And Kids</h2><p>Today, John Bosa lives happily with his wife, Cheryl, and their two sons, Joey and Nick.&nbsp;</p><h3>Brief Info On Cheryl Bosa</h3><p>Cheryl Bosa is the wife of John Bosa and also a proud mother.
