The singer was left "shattered" by his sibling's death.</p><p>His mother passed away in 2003, and in 2014 Marti was distraught when his dad lost his battle with cancer.</p><p>Marti, now 57, has carved out a successful career in musicals - including playing Che in Evita and the narrator in Blood Brothers.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018 he announced he was leaving Wet Wet Wet for good to concentrate on his acting career, and was replaced by popstar and <a href=#>The Voice winner Kevin Simms</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Neil Mitchell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NINTCHDBPICT000789683695.jpg><p>Keyboard player Neil was ordered to take part in a domestic violence programme after beating up his girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><p>The musician, 57, admitted pushing and punching his partner Olivia Warren after a booze fuelled evening in Fulham, south west London in July 2009.&nbsp;</p><p>His defence lawyer Jill Evans told Kingston Crown Court, in Surrey, that the incident was down to a drink problem and he was now going to counselling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Neil was banned from contacting his ex and ordered to take a domestic violence class.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022 he announced he was leaving Wet Wet Wet.&nbsp;</p><p>He said: "I feel it's a good time for me to exit stage left.

If you pour alcohol on me, I'm like firework. I am going to go off.</p><p>"Beverley is a powerful, strong woman. That is the big attraction for me. She is very opinionated.</p><p>"But the tempestuous aspect of our relationship came from me. It didn't come from Beverley.</p><p>"Thankfully, I don't drink any more. That fire has dissipated. I don't drink at all. I am clean and sober.”</p><p>He admitted in 2020 he hadn’t spoken to Marti since he left the band.</p><p><a href=#>He said</a>: “I haven’t spoken to Marti for the best part of three years. He’s a personal friend and I love him deeply. He decided to move in his direction and we decided to move in our direction.”</p><p>Graeme told he hired <a href=#>“gregarious”</a> Kevin Simms in 2020 when he auditioned to replace Marti.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tommy Cunningham</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tommy-cunningham-comp-kd.jpg><p>Like Marti, Tommy has left the band not once, but twice.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1997 the drummer, now 58, fell out with his bandmates in <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a row over royalties</a> and quit.&nbsp;</p><p>While not performing he set up a taxi firm and opened a bar in Duntocher, West Dunbartonshire.</p><p>But he re-joined with the rest of the band in 2004 and stayed with them until last year.</p><p>He announced his departure due to a problem with his hearing.</p><p>He wrote on Facebook: “I knew back then that I was doing some irreparable damage to my hearing but I had believed that I had it under control.</p><p>“During the last two years of lockdown it has become increasingly clear to me that over time my tinnitus has increased in intensity to the point where I now have constant loud ringing in my ears, which affects almost every wakened moment.</p><p>“Due to this I have come to the very difficult decision where if I want to retain any hearing at all in the future then I must hang up my drumsticks and stop performing live shows.”</p><h2>Graeme Duffin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/comp-graeme-duffin-kd.jpg><p>Guitarist Graeme - known as “the fifth Wet” - was deliberately kept out of the limelight by order of their record label as an accompanying guitarist and producer.&nbsp;</p><p>The 66-year-old was once scolded by Phonogram for appearing in publicity shots for a kids TV programme.&nbsp;</p><p>He said: “The following week that shot, with me bang in the centre, appeared on the cover of some teen magazine. The record company was not happy about that.”</p><p>But Graeme never minded and preferred to concentrate on music, rather than the showbiz lifestyle.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He has stayed in Glasgow with his wife and kids but is still happy to be performing with The Wets.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>He said</a>: “We’ve now had Mexit, Texit and Nexit.
