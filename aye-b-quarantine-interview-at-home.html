The rapper had plenty of events and plans on the go prior to self-isolating, including being out in the desert for Coachella.&nbsp;Hot off her fun performance on Bravo’s hit series Below Deck, the budding rapper just released her newest jam, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>‘Nobody’ with <strong>Hotsauce</strong></a>, one of the producers behind <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ariana Grande’s</strong> successful career</a>, just in time for everyone’s quarantine dance parties! Ashley opened up EXCLUSIVELY to <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> about how she’s spending her time at home while focusing on her career through it all.</p><p><b>What are you binge watching? </b>“I am binge watching Homeland, Marrying Millions, High Fidelity and tons of scary movies! It feels like all I do is make tea and watch TV!”</p><b>What are you doing to workout or stay fit at home? </b>“I have [been] getting exercise by going on walks. Yesterday I did a three hour walk and I [had] a little concert. <strong>The Chainsmokers</strong> were playing their <a href=#>new music</a> in their house while I was walking past, so it felt like I was at Coachella!” <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/singer-ashley-brinton-coachella-quarantine-zaydn-post-2.jpg><p><b>What are your at home quarantine essentials? What did you stock up on?&nbsp; </b>“When I was on tour, our tour bus stopped in Nebraska and I got a ton of canned spicy tomatoes. I’ve gone crazy eating them. I’ve finally finished all of those. So now I Postmates all my groceries which is pretty much my favorite pasta with sauce and Eggo waffles with syrup. I’ve also ordered a ton of La Colombe Coffee which is my absolute favorite. Their regular draft lattes and vanilla!”</p><p><b>What’s on your Quarantine playlist? </b>“I’ve actually been recording a lot during quarantine but I have <strong>Lil Uzi Vert</strong>‘s new album and <strong>The Weeknd</strong>‘s new album on repeat.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><b>You have worked so incredibly hard to get to this point. Could you have ever imagined a virus would cause you to reschedule everything? </b>“Honestly, if you told me this would’ve happened a month ago I wouldn’t have believed it. It’s so sad that so many lives have been lost and its affected people’s lively hood, so my heart goes out to those people, of course. And while it’s a shame I had to postpone my very first tour, I believe everything happens for a reason and honestly I would never want to put my fans in a place of danger.&nbsp; I would never wan’t put myself in a place of danger with my team, but we’re definitely going to go back out on tour soon and we’re looking forward to it.&nbsp; Right now, I’m praying that everybody stays safe.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><b>Going on tour with Mod Sun must have been amazing! What was it like travel together? </b>“Honestly, it was so much fun to travel together! Every single night was like a party! It was just an experience that I’ll never forget, especially being my first tour! Mod Sun is so dope. His personality is like no one else’s, so it was a lot of fun getting to interact and getting to share special memories I will never forget. It was really fun because we got to travel across the United States, but we had to be really careful not to interact with any other people while we were driving back.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/singer-ashley-brinton-coachella-quarantine-zaydn-post-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5><b>Tell me what made you decide to release Nobody now? </b>I wanted to release this single since the first day I recorded it, but now just felt like the right time because music gets people through tough times.&nbsp; This song really inspires me and puts me in a better state of mind so I wanted to share that with my fans.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><b>What was it like to film the the video? “</b>Filming a music video with<strong> Jeff Adair</strong> was such an amazing experience. <strong>Yella Beezy</strong> was just such a pleasure to work with we just turned up and had the best time filming the video. It’s a dope piece of art that I’m so excited I can finally share with the the world.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH11e5ByZpqxlWKvbr3UmqmapqSeu6Z5yKernqqmnrK4ecCtZKGnnZp8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./teen-mom-jenelle-evans-slammed-showing-weed-tray-addiction.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Teen Mom Jenelle Evans slammed for showing off 'weed rolling tray' to her mom Barb after past drug a">&larr;
