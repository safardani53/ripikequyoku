I used to leave the house at 7am and wouldn’t get home until 9pm.</p><p>"I’ve never had any financial help from the government or the council.

On my pension, I can’t afford to live here any more.</p><p>“It is my family home, so when I hear I’m paying more council tax than millionaires it makes me feel sick.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Related Stories</h2></p><p>Irene’s house, and all those on her side of the street, are in Band C of the eight-band council tax scale.</p><p>That ranking was based on the value of their properties 26 years ago.</p><p>Since then, no government in England or Scotland has dared revalue domestic properties, fearing a backlash from wealthy areas where property prices have ­rocketed.</p><p>Wales revalued in 2005 and there was an outcry as a third of houses were landed with higher bills.</p><p>The current value of Band C properties in Oldham ranges from about £125,000 to £160,000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nintchdbpict000304091156.jpg><p>Matthew Cooper, 30, and his ­partner Jemma Routledge, 29, who have a four-month-old daughter Chloe, bought their Middleton Road home two years ago for £130,000.</p><p>NHS business manager Matthew said: “I knew my council tax bill was expensive but I always thought it was just a part of owning your own home.</p><p>“It is utterly ridiculous that we are paying more than people in London. How can the Government and councils justify that huge ­discrepancy? If you look at this area, it’s hardly Mayfair, is it?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nintchdbpict000304090905.jpg><p>Retired hairdresser and widow Joan Chadderton, 75, moved to the ­Oldham street 49 years ago. She has never claimed from the state.</p><p>She said: “I manage to get by but it isn’t easy. So to hear I’m paying more council tax than people who live in such lavish homes in London breaks my heart.</p><p>“Surely the whole system needs looking at again?”</p><p>The average council tax bill in Britain is expected to top £1,600 for the first time this year — up from £1,530.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nintchdbpict000254765269.jpg><p>Apartments in One Hyde Park have sold for a combined total of more than £2billion.</p><p>But the 86 ­residents will each receive a council tax bill for just £1,376 this year.</p><p>In 2014, a penthouse flat there sold for £140million, making it London’s most expensive property.</p><p>Around half of One Hyde Park is owned by billionaire former ­Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al Thani.</p><p>Alex Wild, research director at the Taxpayers’ Alliance, described the council tax system as “a mess”.</p><p>He said: “The only significant ­revenue-raising power that local ­authorities have is council tax — a blunt instrument that hits the ­poorest hardest.”</p><p>Councillor Abdul Jabbar, deputy leader of Oldham Council, said: “Our funding has been cut savagely by government.</p><p>“We have had to make savings of more than £200million since 2009/10.</p><p>“It’s a further case of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer under this government.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4Z2gZhqaWibn6q7pLXLZquasF2ntrF5zp%2BdZpmjYq%2BquMuipqeZmaeytHnPmrBmpJWowG7Ax5qlZqeimbavrdGyZJ%2BZnZ65qrHSZqCnZZSavbO11Z6bZpmimq60ew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cuban-doll-king-von-sister-fight.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cuban Doll and King Von's Sister, Kayla B, Got Into a Physical Altercation">&larr;
