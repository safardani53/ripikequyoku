I saw it yesterday morning.</p><p>"It was just a broken bike. It looked like someone had just dumped it. I don't know if it worked but I wouldn't have used it.</p><p>"It's definitely the one in the photo. It stands out.</p><p>"I've never seen anybody using it - it was just dumped."</p><p>The bike was found in Redhill, Surrey at around 5pm - but police say no child has been reported missing yet.</p><p>Surrey Police are set to hold a press conference at around 3pm.</p><p>The youngster&nbsp;was reportedly seen stepping inside a black, modified, Volkswagen transporter with a sliding door and an alloy wheel missing.</p><p>A widely circulated photo released by police yesterday appeared to show the van - but the owner came forward this morning and has been ruled out of the investigation.</p><p>Cops are still looking for a similar style van with no side writing, no roof rack, and sliding doors.</p><p>A spokesman said that police dogs and officers remained out in Redhill and he surrounding areas and said they are treating the report "extremely seriously".</p><p>They said: "Although the black van from the CCTV footage has been found and discounted, the description of the van from the passerby still remains.</p><p>"Officers are out and trying to track down the owner of that vehicle and we urge the owner to get in touch with Surrey Police."</p><p>They added:&nbsp;"It remains extremely important that if you own or know the owner of a vehicle like this which could have been in Redhill yesterday afternoon that you contact police immediately.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Related stories</h2></p><p>"We would also like to speak to anyone who was on Redstone Hill at around 4:30 to 5pm yesterday or anyone who recognises the mountain bike and may have seen who was riding it yesterday afternoon."</p><p>Cops are making "numerous enquiries" into the incident and trying to determine whether the boy and person in the van knew each other.A force spokesman said: "We are currently trying to get to the bottom of what a member of the public, who reported the incident to us, saw.</p><p>"We don't yet have a report from a &nbsp;parent of a missing child, and need to urgently find out who the child is.<br>"We have a good description of the van, but do not have the full number plate."</p><p>The boy, believed to be around six-years-old, left his bike at the bottom of a set of stairs and police spent the night searching the area after receiving the alarm.</p><p>A spokesman for Surrey Police said: "A member of the public reported seeing the child taken into the van at 4.43pm today in Redstone Hill. The van then left the area."</p><p>The child has been described as being white, approximately 4ft tall and around six or seven years-old.</p><p>The spot where the boy's mountain bike was found, a small dingy, ivy-lined stairway up to the train station, strewn with empty cans and old newspapers, was busy with commuters this morning.</p><p>Heading in and out of the station, they expressed their shock at yesterday's abduction.</p><p>One said: "I couldn't believe it when I heard. It's absolutely terrifying - broad daylight, little boy. It's scary."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/coponphone.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/redhill-stairs.jpg><p>Another told how he had arrived back into the station just an hour after the alleged abduction.</p><p>He said: "I saw it on the news this morning. It's shocking. I've got a little boy and it's really worrying."</p><p>Terri Anne lives in a flat opposite the site where the boy's bike was photographed by police yesterday.</p><p>The 27-year-old said: "I didn't see anything, there were no sirens, nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>"I first saw it on Facebook, following it all through the night - it's so scary because I've got a six-year-old.</p><p>"I couldn't let him out my sight. If he is even out of my sight for a second, if I lose him in a shop g whatever then I panic, because he's got no chance.</p><p>"We've been talking about it online and the fact that he hasn't been reported missing is bizarre, it makes me think that maybe it's a custody thing between two parents.</p><p>"I moved her two months ago and o really like the area. I'm still just getting used to it and getting to know it, but it seems really nice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"This is the first thing that's popped up and made me think, maybe it's not all that safe.</p><p>"But very protective anyway. I don't let them play outside yet or anything like that - even less so now."</p><p>Superintendent Bex Smith from Surrey Police said: "This is an incident we are taking extremely seriously and are asking for anyone with any information regarding the child, the van or what happened to come forward.</p><p>"If you were in the area, perhaps commuting to or from Redhill train station at the time please get in touch with us if you saw anything suspicious.</p><p>"At this stage we are not ruling out a number of options, including whether the child and the person in the van know each other.”</p><p>Anyone with any information should contact Surrey Police and quote Operation Bigfoot.</p><p>Alternatively you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111.</p><p><b>We pay for your stories!
