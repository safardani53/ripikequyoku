Per the report, Chris Brown and Rihanna were engaged in a “verbal dispute” when she slapped him and he responded by shoving the star into a wall.</p><p>Then, in January, Brown and Rihanna were vacationing in Barbados and got into an argument while riding around in a borrowed Range Rover.</p><p>Brown got out of the vehicle and, enraged, smashed the driver and passenger-side windows. The incident went unreported at the time.</p><p style=text-align:center>Chris Brown and lawyer Mark Geragos arrive at court.</p><p>Rihanna had agreed to cooperate with prosecutors and was willing to testify against Chris Brown over the assault that left her battered in February, but he <a href=#>cut a plea deal</a> before his preliminary hearing that precluded a trial.</p><p>The fallen R&B star was <a href=#>formally sentenced</a> Tuesday to five years’ probation, 180 days of hard community labor and 52 weeks of domestic-violence counseling.</p><p>Despite objections from both camps, the judge extended a strict stay-away order that prohibits Brown from coming within 100 yards of Rihanna … until 2014.</p><p>While there has been much debate over what happened that night between Chris and Rihanna, the official police report has never been released … until now.</p><p>That Brown has a <a href=#>history of violence</a> is not nearly as shocking as what happened in February. Follow the jump to read the details of what Rihanna told cops …</p><span style=display:none>&nbsp;</span>Rihanna told police she got into an argument with Chris Brown over something that had occurred at an event they were at earlier in the evening.<p>The report reads:</p><p>“The victim said she became enraged and slammed both of her fists against the dashboard on the passenger side of the car they were in. She reported that the defendant then pulled the vehicle over and reached over her with his right hand.”</p><p>“He opened the car door and tried to force the victim out.”</p><p>According to the report, Chris Brown was unable to shove Rihanna out of the car, though he tried, because she was wearing a seat belt.</p><p>The report continues, “When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against the passenger window.”</p><p>“The victim then faced the defendant and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then continued driving. As he drove, he continued to punch the victim in the face with his right hand while steering with his left hand.”</p><p>Rihanna told police the “assault caused her mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter over her clothing and the inside of the car.”</p><p>Rihanna told police after Brown “stopped his first assault .. she looked in the mirror and saw her eye beginning to swell.</p><p>[Brown] looked at [Rihanna] and said ‘I’m going to beat the sh!t out of you when we get home! You wait and see!'”</p><p>Rihanna told police she tried to call her personal assistant, but she didn’t pick up – but Rihanna says she “pretended to talk, saying, ‘I’m on my way home. Make sure the cops are there when I get there.'”</p><p>Rihanna says she did this “because she did not want to get beat anymore.”</p><p>But after Rihanna’s fake phone call, she claims Brown became even more enraged with her, looked at [Rihanna] and said, “You just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I’m really going to kill you!”</p><p>Rihanna told cops that Brown unleashed a second wave of punches, “during which time [Rihanna] interlocked her fingers behind her head and brought her elbows forward to protect her face.”</p><p>He continued to punch her on her left arm, which caused a contusion on her left tricep.</p><p>At that point Rihanna tried texting her assistant.</p><p>Brown threw the phone out of the car, stopped the car and Rihanna then tried opening her door to get out, but Brown sped off and the door shut with her inside.</p><p>Brown placed Rihanna in a headlock while he drove, then bit her on her left ear. The car eventually stopped and Rihanna took the keys out of the ignition, and Brown began to punch her again in the face and arms.</p><p>He placed her in a headlock and started applying pressure to her carotid artery. She couldn’t breathe and began to lose consciousness. She tried freeing herself, and Brown bit her left ring and middle fingers and then released her.</p><p><strong>Rihanna took off her shoe and tried breaking the passenger window, all the while Chris Brown continued to punch her.</strong></p><p>Eventually, Chris Brown got out of the car. Rihanna opened the door and continued screaming. Brown began punching her again. He got back in the car and screamed “Where are my f***ing keys?”</p><p>He got out, looked for the keys in vain, and when he could not find them removed several CDs and walked away. Officers were called and observed numerous contusions and abrasions to Rihanna’s face, forehead and left arms.</p><p>There were other injuries as well. Investigators determined Brown was wearing a large ring on his right hand which caused several of Rihanna’s injuries.</p><p><strong>Did Chris Brown receive a fair sentence?</strong></p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2lxX2WFcK%2FHq6CsZZKnvLi6jJqqrJmlocFuvsihmKemkWKxpsDAoqOsZZSkuqa%2F06KaZq6ZpLmmusKeZKGho6m8s8WMqZisrF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kenny-chesney-reacts-jimmy-buffett-death-7965136.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kenny Chesney Reacts to Jimmy Buffett's Death">&larr;
