I remember asking her, 'why did you shave your head?' And her answer was a bit weird.</p><p>"It was, you know, 'I just don't want anybody, anybody touching my head. I don't want anyone touching my hair. I'm sick of people touching my hair.'"</p><p>Britney asked for a tattoo of another woman's lips to begin with, then a small cross.</p><p>Emily claims no one on her team tried to help or intervene, adding: "It just didn't seem like they cared very much. I've felt this insane sense of anxiety and energy that felt so negative.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>"It just seemed like everybody was waiting for the crash to happen."</p><p>The hair shaving incident happened after she fled from rehab in Antigua.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000480774245.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000585295392.jpg><p>She turned up at her ex Kevin's house and demanded to see their sons, but he allegedly refused.</p><p>This led to Britney driving to an <a href=#>Los Angeles</a> hair salon and asking to have her head shaved. When the hairdresser tried to talk her out of it, Britney grabbed the clippers and did it herself.</p><p>Afterwards, the singer was placed under conservatorship, which meant her dad Jamie had control over her financial and personal assets.</p><h2>FINALLY FREE</h2><p>It's been 13 years but finally Britney has been freed from the conservatorship.</p><p>On November 12 2021, after a lengthy legal battle and #freebritney fan campaign, a judge agreed to end Britney's conservatorship for good.</p><p>A member of the singer's legal team told The Sun ahead of the pivotal hearing: "She has been emotional all week and was crying last night both happy tears and tears of joy. I think she doesn’t fully believe it’s coming to an end yet after so many years of pushing and fighting.</p><p>They added, "She keeps saying “I can’t believe it’s really happening” and I don’t think it will sink in until after the hearing.”</p><p>The source added that Britney, 39, is feeling ready for justice after spending 13 years of her life under the extremely <a href=#>restrictive conservatorship</a>.</p><p>“She spent years afraid of her father but she’s not afraid anymore. She’s confident and ready for vengeance and with her new team around her, that’s exactly what she is going to get." they told The Sun.</p><p>"This is only the beginning of justice for her and only the beginning of investigations into anyone who has wronged her over the years.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000619675564-3.jpg><p>The decision followed the judge's decision in September that Jamie should be suspended from the conservatorship with immediate effect. A temporary conservator was put in place for a month until the November hearing.</p><p>The songstress started seeing more progress over the summer after she was granted permission to finally choose her own attorney. Britney opted for Mathew Rosengart.</p><p>Earlier in the year, a LA judge ruled that&nbsp;<a href=#>Jamie would no longer have sole control</a>&nbsp;of her multi-million dollar fortune&nbsp;following public outcry supporting <a href=#>the #FreeBritney movement</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>JAMIE'S HEALTH</h2><p>A source close to&nbsp;Britney&nbsp;told The Sun: "Since Jamie's health has improved, Britney&nbsp;<a href=#>does everything she can to avoid spending time</a>&nbsp;with her father."</p><p>Though Jamie once suffered from a colon rupture in 2019, leading Britney to shut down her Las Vegas residency, the source said the 68-year-old has recovered from the setback.</p><p>"His health seems to have improved after a long period of everyone being worried he wouldn’t make it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000635740742-7.jpg><p>"Those around her feel Jamie uses guilt tactics when it comes to spending time with him.</p><p>"He uses his ailing health and tries to get her to help take care of him.</p><p>“Jamie wants to have a close relationship with Britney but with the conservatorship in place, it's become close to impossible."</p><p>While Britney's fans wanted to overthrow the conservatorship, members of the singer's team - aside from her mom, sister and Sam - still&nbsp;<a href=#>didn't believe the singer was ready for full emancipation</a>&nbsp;and needed her dad's support.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000636495023.jpg><p>Meanwhile, Britney's songwriter Claude Kelly said <a href=#>the singer was "treated like a toddler"</a> by her team.</p><p>Claude, who worked on her 2008 album Circus shortly after Jamie, 68, took control, told The Sun: “She’s 39 and she’s been doing this a long time, it doesn’t make sense that she’s being handled like a toddler who has no rights."</p><h2>HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE</h2><p>Claude went on: “The whole thing brings up a bigger issue of human rights and it doesn’t make sense to remove the right for people to live the way they want to live.</p><p>“There’s hundreds of other celebrities that have had pretty tough times like public breakdowns, public divorces or embarrassments and they haven’t needed to lose all of their rights.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“If that’s the case then we should all be worried because we are all going to f*** up, fall short and make mistakes.</p><p>“God forbid that someone can come in, whether it’s your father or your mother, your husband or your wife or whatever and decide, ‘You no longer have the right to decide how you live your life’.”</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Britney Spears’ dad Jamie loses sole control of singer’s estate in legal battle over conservatorship</span><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqY2p9d36PaJmroaSjsrp50qmcmqqjYr%2BmrdKopWarmJbDprCMoZyanF2lwqO4yJxkpp2cqbGww81o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./daniel-smith.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Daniel Smith net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr;
