Here, we've found the best beauty boxes which will deliver coveted brands to your doorstep – and save you money.</p><p>It's easy to get into a rut and stick with the products you've known and used for years: we get it. But while the saying holds true that 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it', sometimes the only way of discovering your new favourite beauty hero is to be sent it in the post in a fabulously curated box of goodies. Who could resist?</p><p>Perfect for introducing you to new products and emerging brands as well as keeping you in constant supply of the ones you love, beauty subscription boxes have become super-popular in recent years.</p><p>They're no longer just a niche thing, either. There are scores of brands getting in on the action and offering subscription plans, meaning there's more choice than ever – and even greater value to be found.</p><p>Whether you're looking for makeup, skincare, perfume or grooming tools, we've tried the best beauty boxes ourselves to bring you our honest verdict. Read on for the best beauty boxes below, and find the plan that works for you.</p><h2><b>Best beauty boxes at a glance:</b></h2><h2>Sephora Beauty Box</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG-0283-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Sephora Beauty Box, £11.95 per month - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> <span>Great selection of premium beauty, c</span><span>an choose products,</span><span>&nbsp;handbag friendly</span></p><p><strong>Cons: </strong><span>No full-size products&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Sephora finally opened in the UK last year and the beauty mecca is one of the best destinations to get premium brands. If you don’t want to fork out, the Sephora Beauty Box is a great way to try popular brands for cheaper prices.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Plus, you get to pick what you get in every box and each month, can choose five deluxe samples across skincare, make-up, hair and body. Skincare has the biggest selection available with over 60 products to choose from. We picked out a 15ml Elemis Pro-Collagen Marine Cream with SPF 30 and a mini Bobbi Brown Vitamin Enriched Face Base from the skincare side. On the make-up side, we picked a mini of Charlotte Tilbury’s Pillow Talk lipstick, Benefit’s Bad Gal Bang mascara and Tarte’s Shape Concealer. We loved the variety of products, however, if you enjoy wearing face make-up, only limited shades are available.</span></p><p><span>While there are no full-size products available, you get to try luxury brands at a cheaper price point making it ideal for beauty lovers who want to try before they buy. It starts from only £11.95 a month for a 12-month plan, making it one of the most affordable subscriptions.</span></p><p><b>Price:</b><span> £11.95 up </span><b>Plans:</b><span> 1 - 12 months </span><b>Amount of Products:</b><span> 5</span></p><h2>Latest in Beauty</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG-0891-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Latest in Beauty, £14.95 per month - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong><span>Wide variety, f</span>ull sizes available, c<span>an pick products</span></p><p><strong>Cons:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Not as many luxe items</p><p><span>Latest In Beauty offers an impressive range of brands and has one of the widest variety of products with hair removal cream, soap, CBD drops and protein powder as options to choose from. With a range of full-sized and sample-size products available, you can really tailor your choices to suit your lifestyle and it’s perfect for trying new brands or restocking your favourites. In our box, we received a full-size version of Fudge Professiona’s Blonde Violet-Toning Shampoo, Revolution Powder Vitamin C Serum and Maria Nila Cream Heat Spray, which alone is almost double the price of the box. Other highlights include samples of Ren’s Protect & Glow Serum, Kevin Murphy’s Bedroom Hair Spray and Mio Solar Power Body Scrub. Despite being a sample size, these products easily had a few uses in them making it really great bang for your buck.</span></p><p><span>The worth is significantly over its £14.95 price tag, and if you continue your subscription for three months, you’ll become a LiB box pro and get benefits including free delivery, discounts and more.</span></p><p><b>Price:</b><span> £14.95 per month (£3.95 delivery) </span><b>Plan:</b><span> Month rolling </span><b>Amount of Products:</b><span> 6</span></p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong></p><h2>Liberty The Beauty Drop</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG-0776-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Liberty The Beauty Drop, £20 - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Rating:&nbsp;</strong>4/5</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong><span>High-quality beauty products, niche brands, m</span><span>ultitasking properties</span></p><p><strong>Cons:&nbsp;</strong>Only four times a year, can't choose products</p><p><span>Liberty is known for its incredible selection of beauty with global brands and niche products. The Beauty Drop offers four boxes a year with products picked from Liberty’s expert Beauty Buyers from £20 a month.</span></p><p><span>In our box, we received a sample size of The Seated Queen’s Cold Cream, which is a multitasking 3-in-1 product that will definitely stay in our skincare routine. Other products included Sunday Riley’s Good Genes, NouNou shampoo, Votary Super Seed Nutrient Cream, 111Skin Rose Gold Illuminating Mask and a full size of Sabonete Bossa bar soap, which can also be used on the body and hands. While there was no make-up, we were impressed with the assortment of luxury brands and the fact that products were versatile to suit most beauty routines.</span></p><p><span>Boxes are sent in mid-January, mid-April, mid-July and mid-October, which coincide with summer and the start of autumn. Plus, the £20 can be redeemable on any beauty product online or in-store - more bang for your buck.</span></p><p><b>Price:</b><span> £20 per month </span><b>Plan:</b><span> One-year subscription, four boxes </span><b>Amount of Products:</b><span> 6</span></p><h2>Pretty Little Thing Beauty Box</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG-0247-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Pretty Little Thing Beauty Box, £13 per month - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>High-quality beauty, full-size, top hair products</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>No skincare included</p><p><span>With a total worth of £123 in products and costing from £13 up, Pretty Little Thing’s Beauty Box is definitely one of the best value subscriptions available and is filled with amazing, high-quality products. It’s very simple - every month shoppers receive a box with a selection of 5 products from top brands</span></p><p><span>We were pleasantly surprised to discover that May’s box included some premium hair products including a full-sized version of Olaplex No.7 Bonding Oil, which is normally £28. This was also one of the only boxes that included accessories and inside was a Cloud Nine pouch containing a wide-tooth comb and silk scrunchie, alongside a St Moritz tanning mitt, which is ideal for the summer months. Make-up items included a Revolution Pro shimmer brick and the Sila Huge Lash extreme mascara.</span></p><p><span>Surprisingly, the box didn’t include any skincare, so if you’re looking for new skincare products each month, you might be slightly disappointed. However, it’s an incredible value given its low price and definitely one of the most underrated beauty subscriptions available.</span></p><p><b>Price:</b><span> £13 up </span><b>Plans:</b><span> 1 - 12 months </span><b>Amount of Products:</b><span> 5</span></p><h2>Beauty Pie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/beauty-pie.jpg><ul><li><strong>Beauty Pie membership, £10 per month or £59 for a year - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> <span>Can read reviews before buying, c</span><span>heap prices for high-quality products, b</span><span>road range</span></p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <span>Formulas for products are hidden</span></p><p>Priced at £10 per month or available for an entire year for just £59, Beauty Pie labels itself as a members' club for beauty lovers. Products are usually marked-up before reaching the shelves, but Beauty Pie sells them before all of those price increases - usually saving up to 80% of typical prices. On both plans, you can spend up to £300 each month – and for the annual plan, Beaty Pie says 'most members recoup the cost of their membership on their first shop'.</p><p>We decided to try out some products to see if they're actually as good as their typical prices suggest - in total, they were worth £140 and we were really impressed by the value for money and variety.</p><p>Upon first use, we could tell they were great beauty buys. They felt super luxurious and like a true treat to our skin. Some highlights included the Plantastic Apricot Butter Cleansing Balm and Superdose Vitamin C Oxygen Boosting Moisturizer. In short, shop Beauty Pie for high quality and low prices and you can check out our full <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Beauty Pie review</a> here</p><p><b>Price:</b><span> £10 per month </span><b>Plan:</b><span> 1 month / 12 month</span></p><h2>Lookfantastic</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-1705.jpg><ul><li><strong>Lookfantastic box, from £13 per month - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong><span>Good variety of products, a</span><span>lways one full-size product, b</span><span>rand collaborations</span></p><p><strong>Cons: </strong><span>Can’t pick products</span></p><p>Costing from £13 a month, the Lookfantastic box offers around six products in every box, which are all available to purchase in full size on the beauty retailer's site.</p><p>Every month, the box has a different pattern or colour to it, and its contents often follow a theme. In the January box, there were lots of hydrating products including a 20ml Polaar Neige Eternelle, a mini 15ml bloom&blossom Hands Up hand cream and a travel-size AHAVA Deadsea Water Mineral Conditioner.</p><p>There was also a full-size body wash from Bubble T the cult classic Deep Sleep Pillow Spray from This Works and a very noughties-looking lip plump from Skin Chemists.</p><p>Compared to Roccabox and GLOSSYBOX you don't always get quite as much for your money with this one, but you never know what you're going to be able to try next because they really keep their boxes under wraps.</p><p>Lookfantastic also collaborates with some top brands, which have included This Works, Illamasqua, Elemis, Laura Geller, EVE LOM, Molton Brown, Sleek, and more.</p><p><span><strong>Price:</strong> £13 per month <strong>Plan:</strong> 1 month - 12 month <strong>Amount of Products:</strong> 6</span></p><h2>GLOSSYBOX</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-1704.jpg><ul><li><strong>GLOSSYBOX, from £11.50 per month (for 12mos) - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><b>Pros: </b><span>Good worth for money, t</span><span>wo full-size items, s</span><span>ustainable options</span></p><p><b>Cons: </b><span>Can’t pick products</span></p><p>If you're looking for a beauty subscription box that doesn't break the bank, GLOSSYBOX might be the one for you at only £11.50 a month (if you sign up for the whole year).</p><p>It offers five products per box, which arrive gift-wrapped in chic pink and black packaging. The box it arrives in also makes a handy storage container if you're all about upcycling.</p><p>We got our hands on January's selection of goodies to see if they were worth the £14.75 monthly subscription and were pleasantly surprised by the range of products and brands that arrived. Our favourite inclusion was a 10ml version of the Nails Inc Gel Rehab Strengthening Nail Treatment which on its own costs £11 — nearly the entire price of the box.</p><p>The make-up on offer was also pretty good, especially the Eyeko Spotlight Highlighter Pencil, which is soft and blends beautifully, and the lesser-known brand Glow On 5th Beauty's Lip Dew. Both items were full-size.</p><p>To satisfy our conscience, there was also Dr Botanicals' Cocoa & Coconut Superfood Facial Cleansing Bar and the box was rounded off with a full-size version of Mudmasky Vitamin-A Booster Blue Clay Mask.</p><p>There was a nice mix of brands we hadn't tried with well-known brands like Nails Inc and Eyeko, so we were met with both comfort products and challenged to try something new.</p><p>The value of this box was £70 which way outdid the cost of the box and because of the full-size products, it felt like we were absolutely getting our money's worth. Because of its branding and the sorts of products available, we'd say this is a great one for young adults to discover new brands.

That means every Roccabox is curated with a blend of better-and-little-known health and beauty brands so you can find ones that work for you.</p><p>You can expect high-quality, best-selling products from Huda Beauty and SugarBearHair to Smashbox and St Tropez. The subscription starts at only £13 a month (plus £2.95 delivery) if you sign up for 12 months.</p><p>We tried out the February 2022 box which was all about getting a perfect night's sleep. Of the five beauty bits that came in February's offering, four were full size and the value of the box was a very healthy £71.50.</p><p>There was Paul Yacomine Body Oil, Skin and Tonic Slow Down Bath Soak, Feather & Down Sweet Dreams Pillow Spray, Beauty Pro Retinol 1% Overnight Serum and Murad AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser, which was our favourite despite only being travel size. That's a very good selection for a bedtime wind-down.</p><p>The brands on offer are high quality and for four full-size products and one very good travel-size cleanser, it's really worth the money. Don't be surprised if you find yourself signing up for the full 12 months.</p><p><span><strong>Price:</strong> £13 per month <strong>Plan:</strong> 1 month / 6 months / 12 months <strong>Amount of Products:</strong> 5</span></p><h2>Scentaddict by The Fragrance Shop</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-1713.jpg><ul><li><strong>scentaddict by The Fragrance Shop, £12 per month - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong><span>Wide selection of designer perfumes, g</span><span>ood for discovery, c</span><span>an redeem subscription price on perfume</span></p><p><span><strong>Cons:</strong> On</span><span>ly sample sizes, c</span><span>an only choose one fragrance</span></p><p>The days of having a single signature scent are well and truly behind us, with many of us beginning to curate our 'fragrance wardrobe'.</p><p>That might sound made up, but it isn't, we promise: it's just a term that describes a collection of perfumes. For example, you might have two or three musky or woody scents on hold for winter and then floral or fruity choices ready for spring and summer.</p><p>But it can be tricky to know what fragrances are going to float your boat because there are so many options, blends and tastes; what one person loves could leave the person standing next to them recoiling in horror. Enter scentaddict by The Fragrance Shop.</p><p>For £12 a month, you can choose one from a comprehensive list of designer fragrances to be delivered to your door. You don't receive the full-size perfume (that really would be too good to be true) but rather an 8ml sample size that allows you time to wear the scent before deciding whether to stick or twist.</p><p>This is a great way to find your favourite fragrances without committing to a full-size bottle. The best part is, if you do find a perfume you really love, you can redeem the £12 you spent on the subscription that month against the price of the full-size bottle.</p><p>And there's a special deal at the moment that gives you 30% off your second month. What's not to love?</p><p><span><strong>Price:</strong> £12 per month <strong>Plan:</strong> Monthly plan <strong>Amount of Products:</strong> 1</span></p><h2>Next Beauty Box</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-1710.jpg><p><strong>Pros: </strong><span>High-end brands included, g</span><span>ood mix of sizes</span></p><p><strong>Cons: </strong><span>No subscription plan</span></p><p>It might not be the first place you think of when topping up on your favourite cleanser or finding your new perfect nude lipstick, but Next Beauty offers a wealth of well-known and high-quality brands. And some of those are in their selection of beauty boxes.</p><p>We tried out their Valentine's collections which they had curated especially 'for him' and 'for her' and we were impressed. The Give Her A Little Love box is a mixture of sample sizes and full-size products and includes Murad, Clarins, Nails Inc, Ren Skincare, MAC and either Bumble & Bumble or Origins. That's a pretty good roster of brands.</p><p>Our favourite products are the full-size MAC lipstick in the iconic shade Ruby Woo and a travel-size version of Benefit's They're Real! Lengthening Mascara. You can't get more cult than that.</p><p>If you'd rather have some autonomy over which products you'll receive and you're not totally convinced by monthly subscriptions, then Next is for you.</p><p><span><strong>Price:</strong> £14 <strong>Plan:</strong> One-off <strong>Amount of Products:</strong> 7</span></p><h2>FeelUnique Beauty Box</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/mime-attachment.jpg><ul><li><strong>FeelUnique Beauty Box, starting from £11.95 a month – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>If surprises aren't your thing, then FeelUnique might be your best bet as you get to choose your box each month.</p><p>To get started, you choose the five deluxe samples you want to try the most – and it's totally up to you whether you add it to one of the three subscription plans, or buy it as a one-off.</p><p>Including the likes of Estée Lauder, Benefit, NEOM, REN and Elizabeth Arden, an amazing range of FeelUnique's classics are all available in the subscription.</p><p>Plans are either three, six or 12 months, starting from just £11.95.</p><p><span><strong>Price:</strong> £11.95 per month <strong>Plan:</strong> 1 month - 12 months <strong>Amount of Products:</strong> 5</span></p><h2>Hoohaa Fragrance Subscription</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot-2022-12-06-at-11-02-46-Valentines_-_Homepage_hero_13_1400x.png-WEBP-Image-1400-×-631-pixels-–-Scaled-91-e1670324618437.png><ul><li><strong>Hoohaa Fragrance Subscription, from £10 - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Hoohaa declares itself 'the home of niche fragrance' – so it's a must-try if you love to experiment with new scents.

The five mini products we received would have equated to £126.45 if we had bought them full-sized, so we were already impressed before trying them out.</p><p>Covering haircare, make-up and skincare, Birchbox ticked off all the boxes with Dr Botanicals soap, a purifying mask by Marcelle, This Works hyaluronic serum, Lise Watier illuminating primer, and Amika's scalp cleansing oil.</p><p>From winding down in the bath with Marcelle's purifying mask to realising the power of exfoliating poppy seeds with Dr.Botanicals soap, we loved every product for the high quality and niche nature of the brands.</p><p>Would we continue a subscription? Most definitely. We would never have ever considered using scalp cleanser before and it turned out to be our favourite item in the box!</p><p>The only issue is that you don't get to select all of your products, and we already owned some hyaluronic acid - it'll come in handy at some point though - read our <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Birchbox review</a> here.</p><p><span><strong>Price:</strong> $13 a month <strong>Amount of Products:</strong> 5</span></p><h2>Cohorted Beauty Subscription Box</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Limited-Edition-_-MZ-Skin-_Mother_s-Day_-Box@2x-e1649926787192.jpg><ul><li><strong>Cohorted subscription, £39.99 a month – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>If guilt-free luxury beauty sounds good to you, then Cohorted needs to be on your radar.</p><p>Packed with skincare, haircare, fragrance and cosmetics, each monthly box holds at least five products from cult names.

The cheapest in this list is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Beauty Pie</a>, with their subscription boxes starting at just £5. At the other end of the scale is Cohorted which will set you back to almost £40 per month. However, you'll find that most of the boxes, including Glossybox, and Sephora, hover around the £12-£15 per month mark.</p><h2>Which beauty subscription box is best in the UK?</h2><p>All of the boxes on this list are available in the UK. The newest addition is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sephora</a>, which only launched in the UK late last year.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Yorkshire-based <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Roccabox</a> is perfect for a more independent, up-and-coming spin on beauty, while Liberty features handpicked items from their beauty buyers.</p><h2>What is the best subscription box for skincare?</h2><p>If you want to make sure you get the best skincare solutions from a beauty box, then it may be better to choose a more personalised box. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Latest in Beauty</a> can be ultra-personalised so may mean you find a more tailored solution to skincare needs, compared to other boxes.</p><h2>Are beauty boxes worth it?</h2><p>It all depends on you! If you rarely splash out on beauty products, you might find that subscription boxes send more than you can use (although plenty allow the option to choose quantities). However, if you love trying out new goodies and are always buying new beauty items anyway, then a subscription box can be a really worthwhile investment. Plus who doesn't love receiving treats in the post each month?</p><h2>What are the best monthly box subscriptions?</h2><p>See above! All of the boxes we've picked out boast monthly subscriptions, meaning you'll either pay a set fee which includes a standard number of products sent out to you monthly—or the fee grants you access to a revolving roster of goodies that you can choose to purchase at a fraction of the normal cost.</p><p><strong>Want to find more savings on your online shopping?
