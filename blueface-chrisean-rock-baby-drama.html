Ever since Chrisean announced her pregnancy on social media in May 2023, social media users collectively decided that they were done with the drama. The pair have maintained an <a href=#>on-again, off-again relationship since 2020</a> that folks agree is the true epitome of toxicity. And now, they have added a baby to the dysfunction.</p><p>It‚Äôs no secret that Blueface hasn‚Äôt been thrilled with welcoming a child to the world with Chrisean. However, Baby Chrisean Malone Jr. entered the world on Sept. 3, 2023. And since then, the rapper and the new mom have been feuding. Unfortunately, their feud went into overdrive once Blueface took to social media to reveal his supposed proof of Chrisean‚Äôs negligence as a mom. SMH. Let‚Äôs explore.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Blueface posted a photo of his newborn son Chrisean Malone Jr.‚Äôs private area on social media.</h2><p>It‚Äôs safe to say Blueface may have lost his marbles. On Sunday, Sept. 23, 2023, Blueface left social media users stunned yet again by sharing a photo of Chrisean Jr.‚Äôs private area in a now-deleted tweet.</p><p>"This is what my son d--k looks like and she worries about me and Lil Baby c--k. Like b---h get our son c--k right then do what you want,‚Äù Blueface shared in a tweet per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Blueface sharing the picture on social media seemed to be a twisted cry for help. Blueface claims that Chrisean Jr. is suffering from a hernia that Chrisean has yet to address with making an appointment for surgery.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">XXL</a>, Chrisean Rock went on Instagram live on Monday, Sept. 24, 2023, to address Blueface‚Äôs actions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Posting your son hernia, for whom to laugh at?" Chrisean questioned per the outlet. "This is an innocent child, bro. You f---ed up. That's all I gotta say, you f---ed up. And it's crazy, I got cool with you thinking it was going save us. It just made you worse."</p><p>Earlier on the IG Live, Chrisean attributed Blueface‚Äôs recent behavior toward her and their son to his being upset that she‚Äôs no longer signing to his label.</p><p>"I'm thinking he just mad about me not signing to MILF Music, for real," Chrisean said. "I only did the video just to be cool with him. Because I know the type of person he is. If you are not cool with him, he‚Äôs going to try to play those bitter roles. Start using the court, lawyers, and CPS. I'm cool ... on anything you‚Äôre on."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Chrisean continued and broke down in tears: ‚ÄúBut when it got to the nitty gritty of changing the name, I couldn't change the name. I don't want to. When it got to the nitty gritty to sign paperwork with MILF Music, I didn't want to. I didn't do it. And then, when he wanted my checks back into his name, I didn't want to do it. So, you post a picture of my son for clout.

This is what I get,‚Äù Chrisean said via a video shared by the gossip page House0fBlues. ‚ÄúBecause I gave a [n-word] the benefit of the doubt to be a dad, to also just expose his son for pleasure. What do you think people are going to do with that picture? It‚Äôs our son, but you're treating it like it‚Äôs my son. If it was your son, I wouldn‚Äôt think you would post your son penis like that.
