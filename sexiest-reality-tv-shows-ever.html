assault courses</a> to bonking in boxes (yes, really), there’s been many jaw-dropping – and bizarre – watch-through-your-fingers moments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NINTCHDBPICT000254258121.jpg><p>While fan favourites like <a href=#>Love Island</a> and <a href=#>Naked Attraction</a> are still on our screens every year, many more have slipped under the radar.</p><p>Here, we take a look at some of the forgotten raunchy gems that have graced the small screen.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sex Box</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/sexy-reality-tv-865604874.jpg><p>Just as its name suggests, the <a href=#>Channel 4</a> show saw couples having sex in a box and then chatting about their experience afterwards.</p><p>Hosted by <a href=#>Mariella Frostrup</a> back in 2013, and then <a href=#>Steve Jones</a> and sexologist Goedele Liekens in 2016, the aim was to shed light on Britain’s sex lives and encourage people to talk more openly about their bedroom antics.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON REALITY TV">READ MORE ON REALITY TV</h2><p>And it was just as awkward as it sounds.</p><p>In one episode, two friends had sex for the first time on air.</p><p>Another cringe-worthy moment saw a couple giving sexpert Goedele a kiss – with the mouths they’d just used for intimate sex acts.</p><p>The show got a mixed reaction amongst viewers, but it was commissioned for a second series – so it wasn’t a total, er, flop.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Undressed</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

dates aren’t nerve-wracking enough, this TLC dating show took them to a whole other level.</p><p>Undressed – which was first aired in 2017 and ran for two series – showed strangers stripping off, jumping into bed and answering some very personal questions to break the ice.</p><p>If they were attracted to each other, the singletons were encouraged to act on it by performing challenges – such as kissing and giving oily massages.</p><p>They then had to decide whether they wanted to see each other again or not.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sex Pod</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/channel-5-never-afraid-push-861729053.jpg>

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ashley-cain-chloe-khan-sitting-306979265.jpg><p>Sex Pod was a 2016 <a href=#>Channel 5</a> series that answered questions that young people had previously been too afraid to ask.</p><p>A panel of experts dived into a wide range of topics – from snapped banjo strings to female orgasms and bladder control.</p><p>In 2017, a celebrity special aired, featuring the likes of Celebrity Big Brother’s <a href=#>Chloe Khan</a>, Geordie Shore’s <a href=#>Marnie Simpson</a>, Love Island’s <a href=#>Olivia</a> and <a href=#>Alex Bowen</a> and TOWIE's <a href=#>Jon Clark</a>.</p><p>They asked all the important questions, such as: “Is there such a thing as too much masturbating?” and: “Why am I always so horny?"</p><h2

four-part miniseries.</p><p>In a bid to spice up their sex lives, three struggling couples agreed to have cameras rigged throughout their homes to capture their relationship – including the intimate moments.</p><p>They then shared their tapes with each other under the watchful eye of a relationship therapist.</p><p>One contestant revealed: “At first I thought it was going to be awkward to be watching the other couples have sex. But then I thought, everyone has sex.”</p><p>It didn't always go to plan, however, with one randy couple seeing their session brought to <a href=#>an, ahem, premature end... when the bed collapsed</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Valleys</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sexual-fantasy-channel-5-series-861735005.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/lateysha-grace-kisses-nicole-morris-865607423.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/series-3-episode-1-pictured-489994249.jpg><p>Dubbed the Welsh version of <a href=#>Geordie Shore</a>, The Valleys first burst onto our screens in 2012 and ran for three series before it was axed two years later.</p><p>The MTV reality show was jam-packed with outrageous antics, including when cast member Jason Suminski reportedly resorted to having sex with a cold Pot Noodle after being rejected by co-star Jenna Jonathan.</p><p>Another X-rated moment saw Carley Belmonte strip topless on stage as the group hit Dublin for a night out, while <a href=#>Lateysha Grace</a>– who went on to star in <a href=#>Big Brother</a> – twerked in a thong.</p><p>As you do…</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Naked Jungle</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/956597de-3087-4b91-bb0b-74b30dc6ada9.jpg><p>Naked Jungle was a one-off game show which aired on Channel 5 back in 2000.</p><p>Using the same set as the CITV children’s show Jungle Run, the concept was controversial because its contestants were nudists.</p><p>The aim of the game - which was like a naughtier version of I'm a Celeb - was to compete in an assault course to win a cash prize of £5000.</p><p>Even the presenter,&nbsp;<a href=#>Keith Chegwin</a>, was naked – although he did wear a hat.</p><p>While the show's full-frontal nudity caused a furore in the media, the Independent Television Commission (ITC) revealed that it had only received one official complaint.</p><p>They said it was from a viewer complaining that he could "do without Keith Chegwin prancing around".</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Only In Bristol</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/raunchy-new-reality-show-promises-861738681.jpg><p>Only In Bristol promised to be “bigger and better than Geordie Shore”, but it didn’t quite reach that scale.</p><p>It aired online in 2017 and followed the lives of ten Bristol socialites aged between 18 and 27 as they lived together in a £2.1 million home.</p><p>They took part in a number of challenges and tasks – and things got steamy.</p><p>One of the cast members, glamour girl Sofia Galloppa, revealed that most of them hooked up within days of filming.</p><p>She said: “We have got nominations, tasks, and all people will be doing is shagging."</p><p>The show was created by American rapper D-Jukes, who revealed ahead of its launch: “We had some great characters come forward.
