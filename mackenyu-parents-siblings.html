It’s none other than Mackenyu Arata, the 26-year-old Japanese-American actor who’s been wielding those swords with style.</p><p>The Asian American actor is doing well in his career. Born in the heart of Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, in 1996, Mackenyu has quite the backstory.</p><p>So, let’s dive into the life of this rising star.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meet Mackenyu’s parents</h2><p>Mackenyu’s parents, Sonny and Tamami Chiba, are no strangers to the entertainment industry. Sonny Chiba, his father, was a legend in the world of acting and martial arts.</p><p>You might remember him from iconic films like Kill Bill, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, and The Street Fighter.</p><p>Besides his acting skills, Sonny was a martial arts expert with a black belt in Kyokushin Karate. Tragically, he passed away in 2021 due to complications related to COVID-19, leaving a void in the hearts of many.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Mackenyu was in the middle of filming Knights of the Zodiac in Budapest when he received the devastating news of his father’s passing. It was undoubtedly a tough moment for him and his family.</p><p>On the other hand, his mother, Tamami, also hails from a background in the entertainment industry. She’s a former actress and model who embarked on her acting career in the early 1970s. She has graced the screens with her presence in various films and television shows.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mackenyu has two siblings</h2><p>Mackenyu isn’t alone in his journey through the entertainment world. He has two siblings – a brother and a half-sister, who share his passion.</p><p>In 1996, his father, Sonny, tied the knot with actress Yoko Nogiwa. The couple had a daughter named Juri Manase, who is 48 years old as of today.</p><p>Juri, with a considerable age gap between her and Mackenyu, became a seasoned actress before her younger brother started his career. Her experience undoubtedly served as a valuable lesson for Mackenyu as he ventured into the world of acting.</p><p>Apart from his older sister, the talented actor also has a younger brother named Gordon Maeda. Born three years after Mackenyu, Gordon is also an actor. The dashing actor is known for his role in the live-action adaptation of the Japanese anime Tokyo Revengers.</p><p>With all three siblings, Mackenyu, Gordon, and Juri involved in acting, it’s safe to say that talent and creativity run deep in their family. It might just be in their blood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gordon-Maeda1.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-cyan-bluish-gray-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Mackenyu’s brother, Gordon Maeda. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>)</p><p>The bond between the two brothers is strong. A fun fact is that they both surprised fans by announcing their marriages on their late father’s 84th birthday.</p><p>In early January, both of the Maeda brothers secretly got married. The specific dates of their weddings were intentionally left unspecified. They kept it a secret for several days before letting everyone know about their marriages.</p><p>However, the identities of their wives remain a mystery. Something we are sure of is that both of the brother’s wives are not celebrities.</p><p>Although there has been gossip concerning <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mackenyu</a> and Natsuki Okamoto’s relationship, they could just be rumors. Now that we know who the actor’s non-celebrity wife is, we can say he was never in a relationship with Natsuki.</p><p>Since the 26-year-old actor prefers to keep his personal life private, he has not revealed the identity of his wife.</p><p>Now, dwelling on the physical attributes of Mackenyu.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mackenyu’s height details</h2><p>Mackenyu isn’t just a talented actor; he’s also got the height to match. Standing at approximately 5 feet 10 inches (or about 1.78 meters for those who prefer metric units).</p><p>In fact, when compared to his One Piece co-star Iñaki Godoy, it’s safe to say that Mackenyu stands several inches taller.</p><p>But don’t forget to check out Mackenyu’s younger brother, Gordon. Despite being the younger sibling, Gordon stands at a solid 6 feet (approximately 1.83 meters), making him a towering presence in his own right.</p><p>Now, let’s talk about his earnings.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mackenyu’s net worth revealed</h2><p>The Japanese actor is not just the guy who wields swords in One Piece. He’s also known for his roles in various live-action manga adaptations.</p><p>From playing Pegasus Seiya in Knights of the Zodiac to taking on the character of Yukishiro in Rurouni Kenshin and Arata Wataya in Chihayafuru, Mackenyu has a diverse range of projects under his belt.</p><p>But that’s not all. In 2018, he also portrayed Cadet Ryoichi in the Pacific Rim Uprising. All these roles have undoubtedly contributed to his growing net worth.</p><p>As of 2023, the international sensation has a net worth of approximately $5 Million. However, what’s particularly interesting is the reported paycheck he received for his role as Zoro in the Netflix adaptation of One Piece.</p><p>According to various sources, Mackenyu was reportedly paid a hefty sum of $220,000 for bringing the iconic character Zoro to life on screen.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The Japanese artist has gained remarkable fame in the film industry.</p><p>Furthermore, it’s essential to recognize that this figure reflects not only his skills and contributions as an actor but also the unique circumstances and dynamics of the entertainment industry.</p><p>With Mackenyu’s increasing fame, it’s safe to say that his earnings and overall wealth are set to grow in the coming years.</p><p>Additionally, he likely pockets substantial amounts through sponsorships and endorsement deals, further contributing to his rising net worth.</p><p>After all, Mackenyu, the talented actor who’s bringing Zoro to life in Netflix’s One Piece, has a fascinating family background, a towering presence, and a diverse portfolio of roles that have surely earned him enough.</p><p>Keep an eye out for this rising star, he is bound to continue making waves in the entertainment world!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57wJyrqKpfoq6kt8SnsK5loJa%2FprrTrGSsoZKhtq%2Bz0mg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./stars-who-regret-their-plastic-surgery-w213028.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stars Who Regret Their Plastic Surgery">&larr;
